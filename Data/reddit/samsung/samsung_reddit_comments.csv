I was using Apple AirPlay to play a game on my phone through the tv. I played for about 3 hours and this started happening.

My hinge is slightly messed up due to drop, where the phone now opens to 170° instead of the full 175°.

43;14pxi1d;Thortok2000;1688649389.0;">Your example was very unreasonable for someone who asks others to be reasonable.

Welcome to the point. If the premise is ""some feedback is unreasonable"" then the example is *intended* to be as unreasonable as possible, the most unreasonable it could possibly be. That was the entire point of the example. It's called hyperbole.

There is no way you can look at feedback asking for a million dollars and walk away thinking ""all feedback is reasonable."" Thus, the point is proven: *some* feedback *is* unreasonable.

And your premise of ""all feedback should be acted upon"" is thus *dis*proven.

>multiple people supported the initiative. You're in the minority

Logic doesn't care about majority. They gave a valid reason why they aren't doing it. If you have a counter-argument, it would involve proving their reason incorrect, not ""but a lot of people want it.""

>arguing over nothing

You're the one arguing. I am simply asking you to be reasonable. Apparently you have some objection to that and wish to argue about it.

The mods are not your slaves. Just because feedback is given or is supported by a majority doesn't mean that will be followed unthinkingly, especially if following that feedback would actually do harm.

Rather than ignoring the feedback or giving a simple no, they *communicated* in detail *why* they won't do it.

This is a perfectly acceptable response that is transparent and open. Sulking because you didn't get your way (or because someone you agree with didn't get theirs) is being unreasonable.

To clarify, the feedback that was given was reasonable. Your response blaming them for not acting on it is what was unreasonable.";0

I literally claimed I *would* if your responses warrant it.

You continue to say incorrect things. Such as this.

Stop saying incorrect things, or stop replying. Or make an argument in support of yourself that isn't incorrect.

Those are the three ways this resolves. (Or a fourth way- the mods lock this.) Take your pick. You already know my preference.

This is now basically an argument, just like you clearly seem to want, as you would rather defend yourself against the criticism than calmly accept it. I'd like this argument to resolve asap. Whether that happens or not is up to you.";0

[This, is not true.](https://youtube.com/watch?v=CYnFhpNSbdk&feature=share8) Resolution doesn't affect battery life much because a) the extra pixels can't be turned off, even when you use a lower resolution and b) the display engine doesn't really get that much more work done with a higher resolution because it's optimized to do it (the exception is when gaming).

The situation with higher refresh rates is completely different. As is using Dark Mode with OLED displays.";0

Just the number of apps that have software optimisation for them are very low, excluding really popular apps.

For example, I know someone who develops a pretty popular webcomic app. And they told me that its really difficult to work with because the screen is too wide for it to default into mobile mode but too square-y to default to tablet/desktop mode.

In the end they basically have to develop a newer UI layout just for foldables.";0

118;14xth02;SHADOWxFLAME;1689189939.0;"I had a pixel 6 ( I know it's the previous phone) but from my experience it was my worst phone I ever had. It heated up constantly, the battery was inconsistent. For instance some days the batter would be amazing and at the end of the day still have 40% while other days with sometimes even less usage would be on 10%, I felt many apps wasn't optimised and would crash a lot. 

I also prefer 1 UI as I felt it's most customisable and offers a lot more as I felt the pixel customisation was rather basic compared to one UI, although it was definitely a more simple UI. Overall the UI is personal preference.

For things like gaming it would warm up considerably more than other phones but for the most part did stay semi consistent frames 

The Bluetooth connectivity was the absolute worst though, it would never be able to maintain the Bluetooth connection Especially if I had a watch and earphones in a the same time.

The exclusive features available to me I felt it wasn't something I ever really needed, but I know people did actually love them a lot so again personal preference.

The camera was probably the best part with it being a really good camera and I don't think I really ever had an issue with the camera.

TLDR:

Compared to using the S23 now I'd say the S23 is far superior to the pixel 6 and is far more customisable with a much more stable phone and better battery. Id recommend the S23 over the pixel phone.";0

188;14wut67;tattooedmama3;1689105886.0;It depends on where you are and how new of a phone you have how soon you'll get them, but Samsung has gotten much better about timely updates in recent years.;0

190;14wut67;BartPRO1000000;1689109074.0;Europe here, the fastest updates I've seen. Getting security patches monthly, and always the newest ones. Got the May one on like the first or the second. The July took longer because there were bug fixes and camera improvements they needed to make. The June one was instant. All the previous ones starting from March were basically instant.;0
191;14wut67;siliconevalley69;1689111124.0;"They do monthly security updates and have for years. Usually takes 6 months to get the new Android version (September--> Jan/Feb) but who cares. 

Google's Android build is way behind Samsung at this point. 

One UI is the definitive version of Android. 

Most of the major Android features the last 5-7 years since the launch of OneUI have been Google finally adding things that Samsung has had for years.

Google's puts out their buggy ""final"" build for the new Pixel in September and spends 6 months letting Pixel owners struggle with it while they actually finalize it. Samsung spends 6 months and delivers something that's finished.

Pick a feature. Like blue light filter. That was on Samsung phones for 2 years before Google added. That's when I stopped caring. Does Google even have long screenshots yet?

The S23U is a perfect phone. Best all around phone since the N10+. Best phone sold today. 

There's just no phone that delivers software+hardware like Samsung. Apple is a close second.";0

The S22 Ultra got their Android 13 in November.
So for the S23 Ultra, I'm 100% certain that they'll receive the next major update in Q4 this year

This is all for US carrier unlocked Snapdragon devices btw. Other regions and carrier locked devices may differ. From what I've learned, Asian countries get the updates first and carrier locked devices get the updates sooner than unlocked.";0
196;14wut67;Generalrossa;1689117483.0;Pretty much better then pixel updates these days. So they are coming before pixel get theres. Also we get 4 years of OS upgrades and 5 years of security. So best in the game.;0
197;14wut67;dotjzzz;1689121077.0;About as good as it gets. The only competition is Google, and that's only because they have three, four this year, phones per year to update and they provide one fewer updates than Samsung.;0

They were able to fix things using a remote control app called ""Smart Tutor"". The phone still stops apps from working every so often, and I have to do a warm restart.

But sometimes it gets delay 5 days after a month starts

It uses enough battery that iOS will show as connected to 5G when it's available/present, but actually stays connected on 4G unless the software determines 5G is needed (downloads etc)


Similar reason why, on Samsung, Power Saving will turn off 5G by default.

The 21 fe will give you a taste of what flagship is like and you'll definitely notice the quality difference when you upgrade. Go for the S21 FE, you won't regret it.;0
283;14wsram;technicallyademon;1689111827.0;"S21FE hands down. A54 is newer, but less reliable than the S21FE.

\- Source, am phone technician.";0
284;14wsram;BeerPizzaGaming;1689115866.0;A54 much better battery but no built in wireless charging and the encasement/ body of the phone is worse.  The S21 has a much better fit/ finish/ look/ feel.  With either I would advise a case but with the  A54 it is mandatory.  This is primarily due to the way the lenses are (A53 was a much better design/ higher quality build IMO) and how cheap and easily the screen can/ will scratch.;0
285;14wsram;No-Guarantee-9647;1689119259.0;Please, please take my hard won advice, and that of more than a few others I've spoken too, and DO NOT buy a phone without a flagship chip in it. My A51 I bought in 2020 aged like fine dogwater. It was great for the first few months (coming from a four year old J36) but it only took one or two android updates to slow it massively. It was genuinely painful to use, especially when I'd see (flagship) phones two or three years older loading up webpages and swiping through menus with many times the speed and half the latency. Finally replaced it recently with a Pixel 7, though we'll see how that ages. So far, the difference is more than night and day. I would take less updates all day over the horrible performance of A series phones.;0

I couldn't afford the S Series phones, so yeah. It's good enough for what I need my phone for. I don't play games, I use a bit of social media, web browsing, and painfully using the official Reddit app.

Another thing to keep in mind that Exynos are terrible in terms of overheating which leads to lag/stuttering and even worse battery. 

Mid range Exynos in the A54 as I've read isn't that bad. I just think Exynos in flagships aren't powerful and efficient enough to power the flagship itself.

Also, using it in the car through bluetooth with spotify and google maps navigating... the phone will drain rather quickly even while it's plugged into the car usb charger.

I may go into a best buy to see which phone would suit me better as $5 extra a month is a drop in the bucket. I think I would miss the macro camera on the ultra if I went with the plus. I've heard nothing but great things about the ultras battery life. Btw, I'm looking at the 512gb versions of the phones. I know Samsung phones have less storage available to use than Pixel phones and with downloading themes and apps on it, it won't leave as much room for photos and videos on the device. I like to be able to record and edit videos on my phone and in order to do that, the files need to be on the device locally. Of course I could get one of them in the 256gb version and then transfer them to my Tab S8 to edit them there. But 4k videos and high res photos take up a considerable amount of space. And the 512 is future proofing my phone because I will intend on keeping it for much longer than 1-2 years if I'm financing it for 36 months. I know 256 is good for most people but I don't want to have to worry about running low on storage. And if I'm going with the ultra, I might as well get the 512gb.;0

23U Pros-
Battery - easily lasts most people a day+
10X zoom is a game changer 
Screen looks great in the sun
Cons-
Heavier 
Same form factor as every other phone for the last 15 years 

Fold4 Pros-
Multi-tasking king! Side by side 2 full apps, plus a floating app (or even 3 plus the float) 
Uniqueish, moreso in the USA. Other countries have more fold options. 
When taking pictures, you can see your recent shots on the left side of the screen, plus have the front screen showing so your subject (especially a child) can see themselves, or you can use the better cameras for selfies. 
Cons-
No dust resistance- I don't bring mine to the beach. 
Keyboards are too big or too small for some people. I do well personally. 
Battery is less than I desire, but with ""Super Fast Charging"" i can power up quickly.

the fold was amazing at the beginning, the inner screen was ""a magical place"" that appeared when you opened the phone...but, with time, i stared to feel that its practicality decreased bit by bit.

the outer screen is too narrow to type on (tried the fold 4, is basically the same feeling even if the screen is a bit wider), the inner screen is too wide.

for watching content, you basically have a smaller screen than the S23U because of the squared form factor.

for web browsing and making research and reading, multitasking with side by side apps, yeah, it is better..but that is about the only (still) great thing about the fold...oh, and the speakers, if you care, are better on the fold.

the battery can't even compare, the S23U being the clear winner, even in front of the fold 4

durability...one day you might wake up, open the phone, and during that, the inner screen might crack...might not happen...but it might...also the hinge can break..not open fully....

so, yeah, S23U is better overall. the fold is better on some niche scenarios...";0
380;14wyo1o;MZero_0;1689102411.0;Coolness factor is definitely something I'm considering, it's just that I heard that some people couldn't open the fold all the way, and that's the last thing I need;0

386;14x70an;dylanjones039;1689121058.0;"The TV itself will upscale the content to make it appear to be in 8k. Tbh, the TV does a really good job at it as well. 

Movies and a few tv shows have been filmed in 8k for years now as it's easier to do the cgi but them released in 4k so it's only a matter of time before 8k movies are released. Samsung is also working with companies to help kick start it all. For example, the Lord of the Rings show was shot in 8k and briefly shown on Samsungs 8k tvs for people to enjoy";0
387;14x70an;Schweino68;1689146001.0;I haven't bought a new TV since like...2014. My main concern with OLED is burn in. During football season, ESPN stays on all-day in my home. From 9/10 AM - 10 PM. Would hate to drop a pretty penny just for burn-in to happen. So conflicted.;0
388;14x70an;doublea94;1689123286.0;Yes this is the reason. It has great upscaling to make your image even better. Not to mention the QN900C is probably once of the nicest TV designs out there with the 0 bezel and metal side rails.;0

With my old Flip, I'd get a bunch of people freak out - mostly cashiers, funnily enough. But nowadays, with my newer Flip (4), I rarely get that in-public freakout, though it still happens.

I do get the occasional comment from my friends, family, or new aquantinces now. Usually along the lines of, ""OMG your phone folds."", or ""Oh yeah, I forgot your phone does that."". But not at the same rate as I used to.

I'm an older gen z and when I was a kid and technology was starting to become more mainstream they taught us all the basic things about it in school, as a result older gen z, millenials and even young gen x are proficient in that department. They taught us the basic skills and it's easy to keep learning from that point and have a basic understandment of how things work.

*It works for around 5 minutes and starts rebooting.*

Picture fizzes out, like it's inverting colour or something, and then goes to Samsung 8k logo that flickers on and off, then goes back to menu and repeat steps.

I tried software update and hard reset. (no change)

I've tried various things. I repasted thermal paste under the heatsink + heatpipes on main cpu board, put small heatsinks on each ram and storage chip. (no change)

I blew fans directly at the back of TV and one connect box. (no change)

I put heatsink on chip inside one connect box. (no change)

I wiggled the cable around to see if there's any loose connection. (no change)

I replugged each connector from mainboard and other components. (no change)

I tested TV with only one of each display ribbons plugged in, and no matter which one I unplug, menu and sound works perfectly normally, no rebooting.

I've ordered a new one connect box and cable, still waiting for those (they accept return if it won't work out).

There's very scarce information out there and absolutely no repair information from anybody, yet, apparently people are getting them repaired by Samsung.

Siri: the most basic of tasks. Open this, send that, check that.

Google Assistant: more complex actions inside of applications. Set this event in the calendar and invite X, Y, and Z. Send them a text 2 hours before as a reminder.

Bixby: leans close to Google assistant but adds hardware control as well since Samsung also makes the hardware themselves. That to me is killer and makes Bixby much more useful. Outside of a Samsung device, it’s not great but that’s where Google assistant picks up to keeping the experience consistent.

It doesnt work well with spotify. Even with spotify mentioned, like ""Play The Weekend in Spotify"", it doesn't know I want spotify open.

The real reviewers are the smaller YouTubers who have to milk out the product by doing several update videos of the same product. This is because they don't have as many products sent to them to review and they most likely buy the device with their own money.

But searches being part of the YouTube culture of measuring assistants can't be reversed now. It's weird that mobile assistants are measured on what the Google company is built for -- searches.

Bixby definitely takes the cake, with a rather big gap between any other assistant, when you need a phone assistant, i.e. something that assists you with your mobile device.

Besides, even if your metrics are more geared in such ways, e.g. whether it can hold a conversation or not, whether it converts your question to a correct online search query or not, etc., Bixby is still a solid second place and consistently improving (it was third before).";0

I don’t know of any electronics company who will just give you another device because you say it has a problem. They all require that the problem is able to be replicated before they consider swapping out devices. It’s not the answer you want to hear, but put yourself in their shoes. You have someone saying something is wrong and they send you pictures of it. Then you get it and can’t get it fault.

683;14wcuzt;nodakskip;1689042474.0;"I have gotten two phones via samsung dot com. First the S20 Plus then the S22 Plus. I did a trade in with my old S9 for the S20 Plus. I did the payment option through Samsung.  I also used this later to get two Samsung watches. 

For the trade in, after you get the new phone in the mail. You transfer to the new one and erase the old one. Then send it back. After about a week they will email and say that the old trade in phone has been accepted. If its not then they may add on to the cost of the phone you bought. So be sure the old phone is good. 

For payments it was around 25 a month to another bank online site. As long as you got it paid off before the set date then no interest was charged. But if you do not they can charge you a high fee. Also its not automatic. You have to go to the website each month and pay off the payment.  But you can do what I did and pay more then the minimum each month. After you pay it off you do not have to do anything. But make sure the site says balance 0 owed.

I found it kind of easy. I just kept my S22 Plus since I did not think the S23 Plus had anything new. And the Ultra was way too expensive. I am waiting to see what the S24 looks like. 

Also one note I should mention if you do it with the payment plan, and they ship the phone. You will not be able to change the address or anything after it ships. I tied to have it redirected to a local fedex place instead of my building after some mail theft. So I had to wait for it all day to show up.";0

Even with a regular 3A USB cable with the 45w charger, it should still charge at Super Fast Charging speeds (25w) and should fully charge a S23U from flat in slightly over an hour (assuming you're not using it while charging).

It's embarrassing compared to the charging speeds we're seeing in other parts of the world. Vivo, Xiaomi, iqoo, etc... Some people tried to defend it by saying it preserves your battery life long-term but that is silly. Because if you're worried about that you can just buy a slower charger.

745;14w0ye3;abachhd;1689078031.0;It all ultimately boils down to features. S22U has bigger screen, in-built S-pen and better camera. If anyone wants these features, they can't just jump to S23 or S23+;0

751;14w0ye3;Whole-Brilliant5508;1689026128.0;Works perfectly fine on my S23 Plus. It does warm up a teeny bit but because of the phone's internal cooling system and me having it on power saving mode, it rarely ever gets super warm or stutters/lags.

752;14w0ye3;Whole-Brilliant5508;1689026265.0;I heard that a'lot of it has to do with the S23 Ultra's screen being quite the power guzzler. For some reason, it doesn't mesh well with the processor chip.;0

But if the performance and battery life on the plus is comparable or equal to the ultra, I'd definitely get the plus. I'll just have to sell my Pixel 7 pro to help pay for it as the trade in is less when getting the plus vs the ultra.;0

777;14v8axf;Hpatas;1688940047.0;They make the screen replacement so much more expensive, especially for me living in Brazil. I had a Note 20 Ultra that I expect getting at least 5 years of use, after 3 the screen started showing some green vertical lines, and the replacement was more than half the price of the new S23+ that I got. I made the deliberate house of getting the plus and not the ultra, because of the curved screen.;0
778;14v8axf;Super_Average00;1688938136.0;I'm in the 10% I guess as I love the curved screen since I had an s7 edge and never really had an issue with them. My issue now is how big these phones are lol. If I could get regular s23 size with ultra screen and features, that would be my choice.;0
779;14v8axf;DrunkenNormal69;1688944852.0;The curved screen when doing photo editing work is actually a really giant pain in the ass. Using my s20 ultra that I still have outside of a case is almost impossible.;0

781;14v8axf;ChristmasCactus49;1688935624.0;Im probably in a small minority, but I actually went from a s22U to an S23Plus just because I had a hard time putting on the glass screen protectors and I hated the feel of the plastic ones.

782;14v8axf;impossibleis7;1688945285.0;"To me, a flat display looks better as well. The curve makes it look like the border width on the two sides are different to the top or the bottom. Makes it feel like the phone has 3 different border widths. Cheapens the phone imo. They used to look good on pre S10 phones, but with the chin, the curve just looks out of place imo (I mean, one ordinary border, two curved, a chin and a hole punch; thats one busy display).";0
783;14v8axf;Dimstatyon;1688944390.0;Yup. Please stop, they're just inconvenient and so easily breakable + much more difficult to protect;0
784;14v8axf;phonefreq73;1688957823.0;I'd buy the S23 Ultra if I didn't have the useless curved screen.  I hate curved screens as it is impossible to find an easy to apply (and replace) screen protector that actually sticks to them.;0
785;14v8axf;AntOk463;1688937327.0;"First of all, curved glass is a must. The the edge of the glass needs to be curved, it makes it look so much better and so much more premium. People loved curved glass, my grandma had a very cheap old LG phone that costs like $300 and it had curved glass, it did look a lot better than my uncle's LG phone with flat glass even though it was more expensive. 

Curved screens are debatable, they really don't add much and also don't take much away, and it is a very costly procedure. But again, it makes the experience more premium. They used to have features, like with the S7 and S8, you can have your phone face down and still get information from notifications because the edge display was vertical and not flat.";0
786;14v8axf;MistaKrebs;1688939316.0;I think the curves on the S23 Ultra are great. Makes the phone feel nicer to hold without a case and just makes the phone look nicer.;0

792;14v8axf;metulburr;1688944306.0;"I honestly like them. But I hate them at the same time. I always feel like it's the Achilles' heel of the screen. Especially how the ottorbox recessed the side protection  right near the curves, allowing a perfect sweet spot corner to crack the screen. 

I am always function over appearance. And to me the protection is more important. I will be absolutely livid if I drop my phone and it cracks on the curve. I do have a high quality screen protector on it, but I would rather not test it. But there is still a small gap between the ottorbox rubber and the screen protector. You could in theory hit that exact spot when it's dropped. And if there was no curve, the rubber case would lip so high it wouldn't matter....but it doesn't.

Edit: spelling";0

806;14v8axf;hachiko2692;1688937939.0;"Curved screens are actually pretty good.

The main reason is content viewing. You put all that tech into giving the Ultra phones the best screens in the world, so of course implement it to the best of its abilities. Looking at most flat phones, especially if they have a bright colorway on the back, it's distracting to see the side bezels that the curves remove. And if people can complain about thick bezels on phones, I reckon this is also valid.

Another thing I really liked about the curved screens is the smoothness when you use gestures. I went from a Samsung A52s to an S21U, so I experienced both flat and curved. I actually wished Samsung would make a phone that's curved on all four sides.

And for people like me, who use the phone mainly for content viewing, video, livestreams and movies alike, the curved phones offer a superior experience.

And guess what, a lot of people actually view content on their phones now, because chances are, if they have a phone that's at least $300, their phone screen is the **best** screen they have on their household.";0
807;14v8axf;Safe_Opinion_2167;1688939868.0;"Remember the Note Edge? Curved screens started there. It helped the swipe gesture from the edge for displaying the edge panels, and it still is. I feel the gesture is easier on curved screens.

So i was thinking this ain't bad. But the next morning, a piece of the screen just fell off the edge where the crack was.  my whole screen turned off and nothing was responsive.

 I learned that anything that hits the edge even if you have a screen protector on the edge is so weak and fragile... so got a replacement from samsung care a month after 6 calls to samsung care which were operated by some call center in india where you can't even understand what they are saying and was told that they need to put me on hold and i wait 30 minutes on hold just to be hung up on.. this happened multiple times, 

so i started complaining. in email support and was told to give a picture of my identification card and fill out a online form. it took them a week just to review that, and they asked for a video of the phone.. took them a week to look after that. in which i emailed them again... they sent a brand new sealed s23 ultra with 512gb memory.

1036;14vt5l7;Cheesybutlactose;1688994721.0;I had a Fold 4 for a couple months until I switched to the s23 ultra and the reasoning was because it was simply too thick to hold on one hand for me. However after using a “normal” phone for a couple more months I dearly missed my fold 4 and why it is because the way it can fold into a tablet is just amazing. But yet I haven’t because of the thickness;0
1037;14vt5l7;InfiniteHall3;1689052664.0;"While I haven't used the S series since S9 lol, one thing I can agree on is the Flip having kinda underwhelming camera. 

Having used both A52/53 and now brought the A54 for a family member, suprisingly the A54 camera isn't far behind the flip. In fact they've very close (camera quality wise.) Ofc the flip4 still have flagship elements like the s8+1 processor so it's gonna process the picture faster and records in 4K60fps (main and selfie cam). But other that, the flip 4 is honestly a bit underwhelming when it technically costs twice as much vs A54. 

Zflip4 has pretty much worse sensors across the board even when compared to standard S21/22/23. So is that why the selfie camera and ultrawide is great in good light but immediately falls apart in lower light 💀. I guess the AI & processing can only do so much. Main camera is good though imo (not amazing).

Now to be fair, I brought the flip for just £650 with trade in so I'm not gonna go too harsh for the camera quality. Plus I already knew it won't have the best cameras to begin with. I mainly brought it for the form factor and the ability to take group pictures without needing a tripod. Though sometimes I still wish the flip could've at least used the same main, ultrawide and selfie cameras as the S23 :( even if it lacks telephoto.";0

I miss the more compact size, but I love this phone.;0
1039;14vt5l7;Amazinglyme298;1689086252.0;Yea the s23 ultra is pretty good. It's definitely much better than the flip.;0

And then now I'm dealing with the pre installed screen protector lifting at the hinge that samsung care + doesn't cover the replacement.

1041;14vt5l7;Amazinglyme298;1688999564.0;"Yea the fold 4 looks really good. Some real good specs compared to the flip 4. I'm thinking if I don't see much changes to the camera I'm going for an s23 lol. And will revisit the flip line when it gets better . I love that the phone flips. 

Because when I had the s21 the camera was so good and on the flip the camera sucks. For me the camera has to be really.good.";0
1042;14vt5l7;Amazinglyme298;1689086193.0;"I had an s9 as well. It was long ago but the camera was good lol. The flip 4 honestly is just for the fact it folds and it cost more with less specs lol. The flip 5 looks nice but samsung will drag the upgrades just to keep selling the phone because the Motorola razr + does much more than the flip and the camera looks really good lol. 
Will see what they say at galaxy unpacked and will decide either upgrade to flip 5 or go for s23.";0

Better and more efficient processor (Snapdragon is better than Exynos)

Hi:
 
Unfortunately, that is normal for the entire HP 15-da0xxx, 15-da1xxx and HP 250 G7 model series.
 
For some reason while NVMe SSD's are supported, they only use two PCIe lanes, so they run at approximately half of their advertised speeds.

Many forum members such as yourself have reported this problem, so there is nothing wrong with your NVMe SSD and there is no way to get all 4 PCIe lanes to work.";0
1075;14w5vaq;cuppaseb;1689059262.0;if i had to guess, the port you're plugging the ssd into doesn't support its full speed. looking at the specs, your laptop seems old, so it's likely its motherboard can't keep up with the newer ssd;1

As I heard, if it has 5 pins before the notch it supports 4 PCIe lanes but I guess hp just bought a full one but didn’t bother to connect all lanes. The laptop isn’t really old but Isn’t new. I guess hp support can confirm if it supports 2 or 4 PCIe lanes.";0

1109;14vf07a;Kon_na;1688974148.0;"I've been using the Flip 4 for 6 months and the quality really surprised me. The battery lasts easily the whole day with normal use, which couldn't be said of my previous phone, the Note 20 Ultra. I even started to use the battery protection, which limits the charge at 85%, because I know the charge will last.

The flip comes with small quality of life improvements I didn't know I needed before I got them. Now I'm considering of only getting the flip models, as long as they keep making them.

My only gripe with the flip is the screen protector, and I hope future models can get rid of it. The crease has developed a small air bubble, which I suspect happened due to the summer heat. But it's not that bad that I still haven't had the need to use the 1 free replacement of the screen protector.";0

I dont know why people are so afraid of the screen breaking when mine was abused and it still holds up to this day no dead pixels no green lines no crease breaks, only problem i have is that darn temp sensor

Edit: i still prefer the form factor as it feels really good on the hand, 
battery on the 3 is subpar but i think 4 and 5 is miles better, 
cameras take good pics but aint something to write home about,

1114;14vf07a;Amazinglyme298;1689008626.0;"I had the s21 for 2 years and upgraded to the flip 3 for a different experience with a Samsung flip. Cool phone, battery life and camera sucked compared to the s21. Then I traded in the flip 3 for the flip 4 since it was about $100 after the July 2022 galaxy unpacked. Right now the phone is in great working working condition. The screen protector is lifting at the hinge and Samsung care won't replace it. This is what I find most annoying about the phone because it seems like the pre installed screen protector lifts after a period of time and they have said lifting it and not replacing it can destroy the OLED panel. So since its under warranty will go elsewhere for a free screen protector replacement. I hope in the future they figure out something better with those pre installed screen protectors. And thats something you don't have to worry about on the S line.

I really want a better camera since I already had been using the s line for so many years. So depending on galaxy unpacked if the flip 5 has a better camera and some additional upgrades I will get the 5 if not I will get the s23 plus and revisit the flip line whenever they decide to better improve the camera. The galaxy flip 5 already looks very good and I honestly love the flip since it can fit in my pocket and small handbags. It's definitely hard to choose between flip 5 and s23. S23 is better if you want the best camera, better battery life but if the small size and being able to flip is more of your feel then the flip 5 will be good. After galaxy unpacked you will be able to decide which one";0
1115;14vf07a;Puzzleheaded-Diet-12;1689010380.0;"Well it depends what your needs are. They both have the same chipset I believe which means running games won't be an issue if you're into gaming. 

1) The s23+ screen will probably be slightly wider than the flip 5 so it'll be more comfortable viewing for gaming or watching videos. That's not saying the flips are bad but if you like wide phones, s23+ might be better for u

2) S23+ also has a telephoto zoom lense which is better quality for if you like taking photos. Z flip 5 is rumoured to not have this and only have main and ultra wide cameras.

3) Flip 5 is more compact and lighter whilst also being unique (u won't get bored as easily with it) , just has a few drawbacks like the telephoto lens. 

4) I heard z flip 4 battery was decent and hopefully this more efficient new chip will make battery life even better for flip 5. S23+ and flip 5 are said to have the same size battery so battery life could be similar as same chip+ battery size.

5) flip 5 is set to have larger cover screen covering almost the full surface area of the back top half panel and will be like a folder shape. 

6) because it flips, it takes more effort to open it than just picking up a regular phone so this could stop you from being distracted by the phone, though the new cover screen size could bring more features.

Hope that's helpful :)";0

- I love the flipping. Its very satisfying!
- I have no issues with the battery. Yes I charge it every evening (its about 40% then), that doesn’t bother me. 
- The folding comes in handy once in a while to take group pictures. Also when setting a few minute timer.
- The little front screen is just so nice. It doesn’t do very much. But just for the time, step counter, messages… very easy access. 
- No performance issues (when playing Wild Rift, Youtube/social splitscreen, Pokémon Go…)
- I dropped mine in a pool, and no problem at all!

What does bother me a little is;
- it collects dust a lot. I like my phone clean, but because of the slightly raised bezels it sometimes gets really dusty in my opinion. 
- the camera is ok. Perfect for everything, but from a €1000+ phone it just feels meh. 
- very sleek design, but the cases make it feel a bit bulky.

Wanted to charge me 400 bucks to replacd the screen. So now my flip is an expensive paper weight. I would suggest waiting out a little to see if there any issues with the folding display before pulling the trigger. Flip is a fun phone to use with the cameras good enough for me. However battery life was an issue as it would only last me roughly about 2/3 of my day with a little gaming (20 minutes), Spotify and random browsing on RiF.

1169;14vpncj;PaddyBennett98;1689022669.0;"Hi all,

Recently bought the ASUS Zenbook 14 UX3402ZA. When I plugged in a Samsung T7 1TB SSD portable drive into the only USB-A port a window came up stating it couldn’t read it. Despite this, the drive still came up in the file explorer, but then kept closing on it’s own with the sound as if the drive has been ejected.

After properly ejecting it, I then plugged it in to the Thunderbolt port and despite the same initial problem window, the drive worked fine and allowed file sharing.

I’m confused. A faulty USB-A or does this ASUS model not support Samsung SSD’s? Or is it something else.

I’d appreciate any advice.";0

1171;14vpncj;DGSAO;1689023055.0;"Hi all, 

I have an S22. Is there a way to require a password/pin in order to turn off the phone in ALL situations? Currently I've managed to get the phone to be unable to be turned off without putting in the pin if the screen is locked, but if the screen is unlocked, I'm able to just turn it off.   


I live in an area where phones are stolen all the time and just want to make sure that as long as the phone's battery is charged, there's no way to turn it off without putting in the pin first.   


Does that make sense? I'd appreciate any help.

As for me, I would think that's the kind of error you'd get when something was trying to access the drive while it was unplugged and/or right after it got plugged in but isn't finished connecting yet. First thing I'd try would be uninstall/reinstall. Make sure it's formatted correctly. Check it for errors. And then maybe change the drive letter.

Could also be as simple as a loose connection somewhere and it's getting unplugged.

They severely lack in R and D and use their brand power to push out products. For example my Samsung stick vac cannot be used without the wheels getting clogged with dog hair, it traps so much hair in its wheels that you can no longer push its roller head to vacuum, after only 2-5 sessions.

Example: We have issues with both a washer and refrigerator that have existed since they were only months old and no one will touch them.  Samsung says they can't find anyone to work on them and now say that our warranty has expired and nothing they can do.

I no longer buy Samsung TVs. They are awful. Software-wise, in the first place, but also image quality is not to the standard LG or Sony and even Panasonic offers.

Samsung phones? Well, the are ok-ish, but considering the fact that Samsung produces the displays, they sell high-quality displays to Apple to be used in iPhones, and for S23 series they still use old displays. They sold the E6 display to Xiaomi, but they didn't use it in Samsung's own phones.

The bright, shiny, flashy Samsung that we have, has failed us twice in 6 years and required a repair.

Not to change the subject but has anyone seen actual sales numbers in the US for the S23 lineup?  I haven't.  I see a lot of bragging in other coutries about huge sales numbers but not so much in the US.  Is it because the rest of the world finally had a chance at a Snapdragon chip vs the dreaded Exynos but those in the US that had Snapdragon's all along aren't all that impressed and/or simply think the S23 isn't worth the cost?  You can count me in the latter group.

Having owned Note's since their inception, the S23 line may be ""all that"" in regards to specs but at what point does it become overkill for the majority of users and ends up being more about ""flash"" (pun intended), better specs ""on paper"" and positive press reviews than anything else?  Kinda like the average internet user going on and on about their ""gigabit fiber"".   Very few actually ""need"" that much bandwidth.

I am not disputing the notion that the S23 isn't a great device, because it may be but since it offers me little of what I need and most of what I don't, it isn't on my list.  I yearn for the days when the device I pulled out of the box was all I needed, didn't require hundreds more in chargers, screen protectors, cases, etc.  I long for a device once again that ""dared to be different"" and gave one choices vs. always trying to shoehorn you into an ecosystem and cared more about looking pretty than actually being an ""all in one"" device.

I personally have been holding my nose since the 9/10 days solely due to the lack of anything enticing enough to upgrade.   For me, the latest flagships offer me less and less of what I really need with each passing year.  Having owned 8 different Samsung flagships over the years, and over 20 in our family.  I find the latest interations of the Samsung flagships to be the most restrictive, ecocentric and unnecessary overkill yet, all in the name of flash over function.  Whether that's inticing to one, may not be to another.  Ironically, many of the same reasons I never wanted an iPhone are why I am no longer considering a Samsung flagship for my next device.

Having to only charge it 2 times per week is game-changing, and I hope they never stop making a high-capacity watch!

I understand your side when it comes to the removal of the 3.5mm jack, but consumers would rather have features like ANC and no cables when they're on the go, which is not possible with 3.5mm. 

As for the SD card, they're not a secure form of storage, and offer lower performance compared to internal storage. Moreover, storage sizes these days are large enough where an SD card is not needed. Transfer speeds are also fast, so hotswapping SD cards are a thing of the past for phones.

Also, I assume that you're an Android user, so your points are completely invalidated since high-end options with the SD card, 3.5mm, and no notch/holepunch exist. So I don't get your complain, why not buy those phones?

Completely removing those components via root is fair. I also hate it when companies include excessive bloat in their phones. I'm tired of chasing SafetyNet though, so I've resorted to voting with my wallet buying phones with minimal bloat.";0

Plenty of reasons to go by, but the most important is that even if you have an 8K capable display there is no broad availability of 8K content and by the time it becomes broadly available your TV will be considered a dinosaur. Meanwhile, 8K is very expensive, so to bring down the price to a 4K TV means that the 8K one is completely stripped of features whereas the 4K is packed with features to have a price close to that of the 8K. In the next 5 years a 4K packed with features will serve you much better than an 8K that will display 4K at best and have no features. Don't bother with 8K until at least 2028. Case closed.

Something else now. Depending on viewing distance as well, but 4K 65' and 8K 65' are barely distinctive in the human eye, so I don't even know what is the point of 8K in below at least 75' size. Would you want an 8K display on your phone even if it was for free? 4K on your phone at this size and distance is already an overkill of an overkill.";0

It's getting very close to that though I've been keeping up with the models since the 1st one, I predict that by maybe the 5th or 6th gen is when I'll get by how it's moving. & IfI feel like upgrading since the S23 Ultra is a well rounded phone.

1600;14uuom2;Dangerbadger;1688928115.0;"TL;DR: iPhone 13 user thinking about next flagship phone to use until it dies.

For the longest time I was an andriod user, moved to Apple, back to Samsung with the S8+ then back onto Apple with 11 & 13. As the 15 line-up approches, I'm wanting some longevity out of the phone. I'm tried of contracts etc. so I'm thinking about buying outright. 

I've been looking at rumours for the new 15 Pro line and comparing it to the S23 Ultra as I want a flagship that will last me.

As someone who isn't locked in the Apple Ecosystem (I have an iPad Mini 6 but a windows computer), is looking at the S23 Ultra a smart move?

I've been looking at reviews both on this subreddit and online and they always talk about the apple ecosystem.. but I'm in the UK and have Whatsapp.. What if I'm not locked in?

Some of the reviews for the S23 Ultra having been turning my head especially with the whole andriod customerisation and also the fact you can get *certain* apps on andriod whereas the iPhone you need to jailbreak. I have a garmin watch, andriod devices.

Can you still load launchers into Samsungs? Are they recommended? 

Let me know if you want to know more. I know there will be a huge bias in this subreddit but I'm hoping there's people who have moved from Apple to Samsung with the S23 lineup";0

1602;14uuom2;HealthySurgeon;1688905885.0;"This is my last resort. I’ve contacted support 4,5 times over the last year trying to get my wife’s screen fixed.

Every single time, it’s the same story. Samsungs systems show we have the care plus on her phone and they try to shove us off onto Asurion. Go to Asurion and there’s no record of any sort of care plan on our phone at all.

I use Samsungs systems to look up the imei for support and it never works, I’ve had to contact support every single time and they don’t ever tell me the imei doesn’t exist, but they don’t give any more info than what I’ve already provided here.

This can’t be a fake phone as it was purchased directly from Verizon. We purchased care plus because we encountered this EXACT SAME experience on her last phone and just ended up upgrading. We previously didn’t have care plus and figured paying the extra would give us premium support.

NOT EVEN CLOSE.

The last conversation I had with a tech was him giving me a support number and telling me support will get a hold of me. It’s been a month now and nothing.

I’ve contacted Samsung literally at least 4 or 5 times for just this singular issue on this particular phone and I’ve had the EXACT same experience before. How the fuck am I supposed to get her screen replaced by the fucking service we paid for? Is it time to start contacting lawyers, like seriously?";0

1610;14u72z9;Useful-Math4418;1688832072.0;"S23 all the way, 
I'm not a samsung fanboy so this opinion is not baised.
G2 chip is just not worth it at 70k and in my opinion one UI is better than the pixel UI, one UI has a bit of bloatware but u can always delete them so no worries about that.
One UI has way more customisation options than pixel UI.
I recently bought a54, I loved one plus 11r but the software is yuk after it got merged with Vivos colour os 🫥... So I ended up buying a54 although is shit at everything except camera when compared to 11r, the UI is just mwaaahh 🤌🏻.
So yeah u won't have any problem with the UI, u will love it.
Cameras are amazing in both of the phones so dw about that too.
The processor is fast as fuck boi.
If u want a better battery life I would suggest to go with s23 plus but s23 has amazing battery life too.

Go for s23 bud.

Edit : u won't notice the difference in qhd and fhd between the 2 phones as s23 is 6.1 inch display and the pixel density is high, samsung displays are always the best in the world when it comes to colours n amoled contrast.";0
1611;14u72z9;fmtn00;1688851131.0;"Can't say much about the Pixel since I don't have it but I watched ton of reviews comparing phones before I got my S23.

All I can say is that the pictures are amazing, really good, and I'd probably say even better than the Pixel (but just from the reviews on YT so IDK). So far not disappointing. Videos are great too, and the zoom is surprising by how good it is.

Battery wise, it will depend on your usage. I am a heavy user, play lots of games and take many pictures, much scrolling on medias etc. So far not disappointed about it. It holds well, I have to charge more often when I use it hard but otherwise, not really, I feel confident enough to live my day without thinking about the battery. When I play hours of games, it drops heavily but that's normal (I play at max performance) but it holds up well. 
If you are a ""normal"" user, it will last you all day or close to it. 
When I do normal stuff on it, I don't even think about the battery.

Android versions. Samsung has made progress on this aspect, it is on the newest android version, newest OneUI and will have updates for longer than the Pixel (this is what is said as to now. We'll see if Google changes that in the future).

So, for me, the only ""plus"" the Pixel has is the size, and it depends heavily on whether you prefer a bigger or smaller phone. I love big phones (I had the Note 9) and was kind of afraid of getting the small s23, but I got used to it very quickly, now I find it the perfect size for everyday usage.

I'll say, the other thing that could favor the Pixel is if you prefer stock Android or OneUI. I really think OneUI is superior, more beautiful and more stuff to do with it. But that is my opinion. You have to look for yourself which one you prefer. 

But both are great phones. If you can have them for the same price, I'd say take the S23.";0
1612;14u72z9;LiterallyZeroSkill;1688870025.0;"I recently got a Galaxy S23U and still have my Pixel 7 Pro.

They both have pros and cons. I'll lay it out as I see it:

Galaxy S23U:

- Better battery life
- Better fingerprint scanner
- Better screen brightness
- Better video recording


Pixel 7 Pro:

- Better camera in just about all conditions
- Cleaner/Better UI with smoother animations
- Faster updates with better updating method
- AI features I think are better on Pixel


That's how I see it broadly. If I had to buy only one with knowing what I know now, I'd buy the Pixel 7 Pro. But decide what's important to you OP and go in that direction.";0
1613;14u72z9;lligerr;1688833314.0;Go for S23. Pixel is more buggy and their videos are Inferior to S23. One UI also has got more features. You get the best of both Google+Samsung. In terms of performance, S23 is way ahead;0
1614;14u72z9;Tsolo25;1688831071.0;If you are not using Dex or Bixby routines and you are not into Samsung ecosystem then go for Pixel.;1
1615;14u72z9;Joshual1177;1688844386.0;Check out this unbiased, blind test of the cameras on the S22 Ultra, 7 Pro and the iPhone 14 pro max. It's probably the best video comparison that isn't biased towards one manufacturer or another. https://youtu.be/iodLcAFJaCw;0
1616;14u72z9;_pinksky_;1688877021.0;"Even if you leave practicality out of it, I think S23 is much much more of the all rounder. Cameras are great, the camera is closer to the ultra version than any other previous versions i.e except for the zoom I think you'll get similar looking pictures in all aspects, even videos.

In Performance SD 8gen2 is undeniably better...like no doubt. Better optimised so, the phone doesn't really heat up or get that warm tbh and delivers good battery life.. enough to last you for a day or maybe a Lil more on medium to heavy usage. Tensor G2 is just an okay okay chip that's designed to do regular tasks, i think the phone heats up as well. If you're gonna do gaming and multi-tasking and such the S23 is much superior in that regard.  It gives you s23U level performance so in that aspect it's a no brainer.

The screen res is honestly not going to matter much, you're barely gonna be able to tell the difference. Samsung screens are great either ways with good colours so trust me you won't notice much of a difference.

Now you'll get more security/OS updates for s23, soo much more customisation options and tweaks you can do to play around with your phone which is always fun to have, OneUI is great, it's arguably the best skin in Android, the perfect middle ground I'd say.
And btw I've heard the service for pixel in India is not that great.
Now if you really really want a pixel I'd say wait for pixel8/8 pro because they will be revealed pretty soon and make your decision.
Other than that get the s23, you will not be disappointed.";0

1620;14u72z9;miney_mo;1688833099.0;"S23 simply because it excels on all the fronts. Pixel's cameras are great but so are of the s23, infact samsung takes better pictures of human subjects compared to the grainy oversharpened & dark pics that pixel takes (see videos - gyan therapy, techwiser etc). 

Also, One UI is simply great! It is, arguably, the best android UI out there and while people tend to refer to Samsung's apps as bloat, I really like them. They are better designed than google's own apps and if you use them, you will actually start liking them. You can always debloat the phone.

If you have windows pc, samsung's quick share is also now available for all laptops.

Battery backup should be similar on both. The only thing you need to consider is the screen size, s23 is very compact while pixel 7p is a chungus. Also, it is easier to find tempered glass for flat screens compared to curved on the pixel.";0

It would be a toss up when it would happen, but it did ruin plans at least once (that is when I decided to change phones).

I personally have a S22 U and a S23 my mom has a pixel 7 pro so that's why I can say how well it does on that front as for anything else I would say pixel thermals are noticeably worse than my S22U and S23 it can get a bit warm with use but it isn't unbearable but day to day tasks is buttery smooth.;0

I would, however, urge you to consider a Oneplus or Realme too, if you don't mind trying out Oxygen/Colour OS. Yes, old Oxygen was better, but the current one isn't bad like people make it out to be. It's definitely 100x better than MIUI.";0

To be honest, I was happy that it was actually performant rather than just feeling performant when scrolling.

I have both a 60Hz and a 120Hz phone that I use reasonably regularly. Most of my devices are 120Hz and while I can tell the difference, I don’t think high refresh rate is that important. Sure it looks a bit smoother but it doesn’t make as big of an impact on the experience as an actually underperforming SOC.";0

I understand the majority of pixel users want to believe that these problems do not occur, and people have ""bad apples"" or ""bad lemons"" but if it can happen to a small 100 or so amount of people, or even more than that, chances are that's a huge hardware issue. That one issue can change how someone will continue to view a pixel product. YouTubers and people who make reviews about them in articles shy away from such topics bc they want the pixel to look good, and some of them don't flat out by the phone themselves, pixel gives them a review unit. All the more reason to admit that yes, hardware issues can and sure do occur, rather that's before or after buying the phone for some time.";0

Yeah, it does it all, call, text, photos, ft, yeah. That's the point of what all basic phones do. It's a mid tier phone. You can't expect the holy grail and tbh I think the a54 performs better than the SE. I've seen people clock some serious screen on time without gaming and with gaming. Yes that varies per user as every single phone does. 

You have both 60hrz and 120hrz which is all great for you! But people who'd like to stay on budget, have a ""flagship"" feeling of an experience without punching the price too high they can get that with other brands and Apple will never do such a thing. That's the most important part about that. The SE is already such an old outdated look, even at Apple's standards and they should've went with the look of the XR and with a similar color palette variety if they needed that phone to sell bigger numbers, but of course, people who use that phone and isn't a tech junkie or a tech enthusiast like myself would only get it bc it's the perfect space of staying with Apple bc your friends and staying on an Apple budget. That budget will only scrape that low for Apple is their ipads lol. 

You can get a 7a, but will it perform the way it should? No, not at all. Why? It's because it varies person to person, and because of the use cases, it will be underperforming, we all know that. Die hard fans will deny it, but people who never used Pixels and who finally can will actually see that stark difference and not be ok with that.";0

1767;14tp7bd;mistermojorizin;1688836639.0;my pixel XL and pixel 4a 5g both died because of something hardware related. google had built up some good will with me because they upgraded my nexus 7P to the pixel XL for free, because lots of people were having hardware problems with the N7P (not me though). Since then, Google support got a lot worse. They removed the free google photos storage. I got the S23+, my first Samsung since the Galaxy Nexus (which also had hardware problems with the screen). First big thing I'm noticing is the S23+ doesn't have a hard fingerprint reader (but neither do newer Pixels). Also, camera is not as good as the Pixel XL (a 2016 phone, if I remember right) nor the P4A5g (which shared the same camera hardware with the Pixel XL). The best phone I had was probably Pixel 2XL or before that the Motorola Droid Max (vanilla software, insane battery, carrier version was rootable, lasted me like 4 yrs). Anyway, in my experience Pixels have great software and cameras, but unreliable hardware. I'm not sure about Samsung yet since s23+ is my first modern Samsung. I guess I'll know in a few years, but for now not too happy about the camera hardware/camera app and that you can't get voicemail in the phone app and that there's duplicate apps that can't be disabled. I do like how fast it is and since it's my first phone with 8gb ram it's pretty amazing how long it holds apps in memory.;0
1768;14tp7bd;HumorPlane2273;1688864906.0;"I don't have anything against apple. They just literally don't have anything to compensate in the mid-range section and it will never be that way. What current android phones are offering for new tech it makes no sense to go with a used iphone XR-12 since their A-bionic chip isn't up to date, and I'm only saying this for people who are tech junkies, people who love to power use, and people who won't say, ""well my phone does everything a phone should do, just mediocre cameras."" 60hrz-120hrz can matter to a lot of people, and if they want it, they can have it with a midrange phone, even if the chip may be lacking. Apple was proud to put a new chip in an outdated body in an old screen, their ""budget phone"", and surprisingly that sold more than the iphone mini(s) of course. 

There's people out there who want more, who don't want an iphone, and don't want the struggles of Pixel, and in America that only option was Samsung, but now there's Asus and Nothing (even though they don't make smaller phones they stay under or near $500+ price point).

Iphones will always have a respectable share in the market mainly because of people my age and not towards the older adults (no offense to anyone). That's their market, tech enthusiast, and teens. As you get older you'll lean out of Apple and Apple exclusive products, which has nothing to do with privacy concerns because young people literally do not care as long as it has a bitten logo.

1859;14uais8;fmtn00;1688839860.0;"Can't say much about the Pixel since I don't have it but I watched ton of reviews comparing phones before I got my S23.

All I can say is that the pictures are amazing, really good, and I'd probably say even better than the Pixel (but just from the reviews on YT so IDK). So far not disappointing. Videos are great too, and the zoom is surprising by how good it is.

Battery wise, it will depend on your usage. I am a heavy user, play lots of games and take many pictures, much scrolling on medias etc. So far not disappointed about it. It holds well, I have to charge more often when I use it hard but otherwise, not really, I feel confident enough to live my day without thinking about the battery. When I play hours of games, it drops heavily but that's normal (I play at max performance) but it holds up well. 
If you are a ""normal"" user, it will last you all day or close to it. 
When I do normal stuff on it, I don't even think about the battery.

Android versions. Samsung has made progress on this aspect, it is on the newest android version, newest OneUI and will have updates for longer than the Pixel (this is what is said as to now. We'll see if Google changes that in the future).

So, for me, the only ""plus"" the Pixel has is the size, and it depends heavily on whether you prefer a bigger or smaller phone. I love big phones (I had the Note 9) and was kind of afraid of getting the small s23, but I got used to it very quickly, now I find it the perfect size for everyday usage.

I'll say, the other thing that could favor the Pixel is if you prefer stock Android or OneUI. I really think OneUI is superior, more beautiful and more stuff to do with it. But that is my opinion. You have to look for yourself which one you prefer. 

But both are great phones. If you can have them for the same price, I'd say take the S23.

Edit : grammar";0
1860;14uais8;Minimum_Leadership51;1688929046.0;"I had a pixel 7pro until 2 weeks ago when switching to the S23+. What can I say, I have mixed feelings about the pixel. While the camera was arguably better, the rest of the phone wasn't. Not a single thing. On the other hand, it's not A LOT worse, but there are some things like battery life or finger print reader that'll make a difference in day-to-day use. What was the final reason for me to change was that I couldn't apply a proper screen protection due to the edges of the display and well...I had a cracked screen after the first time it fell.

Edit: The price of the pixel was slightly lower, so that's a pro, I guess.";0
1861;14uais8;Pretend_Tooth_965;1688846183.0;They are actually two different animals. Pixel is 'keep it simple stupid' and Samsung is 'every option and the kitchen sink'.  I have both a P6P and an S22U and alternate my SIM in each because I still can't decide.;0
1862;14uais8;Generalrossa;1688948087.0;Keep in mind the pixel 7 pro has battery life and heating issues. The issues all over everywhere so it won't be hard to research.;0
1863;14uais8;bop426;1688957129.0;I had a P7P and had the green screen display failure. I got a replacement from Google and sold it. I was leery of the issue recurring. I still like Pixels and got a 7a. I also bought an S23U. It's a great phone but too big and heavy for me. I sold that and got an S23+. I like it a lot. Battery life is excellent as is the display, the UI and size/shape. The Pixels have a slight edge on photos but the Samsungs are close. I can't decide which I want so I decided that I'd have both. I don't have any expensive hobbies otherwise. Right now if I had to pick one I'd keep the S23+ (or S23). The Pixel 8 may change that. It never ends...;0
1864;14uais8;inventord;1688848776.0;TBH I would go for a Pixel 7 Pro. It's a better, more well-rounded device, and IMO it really comes down to how much the extra android update matters to you (the speed difference shouldn't be noticable, and stock android has really nice animations). Both are good devices either way though.;0

1882;14u3bb5;darkturtleforce;1688838081.0;It's the carriers. When you carrier unlock a phone that was previously locked to a carrier, sometimes it disables wifi calling and volte/HDvoice. If you can flash the unlocked software version onto the phone, it restores those functions. Not sure if that's an option on the s20, careful you don't brick the phone if you've never done it. Last time this happened to me it was with an s7 and you could still flash software relatively easily but I think they locked down the bootloader more since then.;0

If you have £500 I would recommend not going for a Samsung laptop but going for a different brand like a HP or an Asus with at least an i5 

Most of the money your paying for the Samsung ones goes on optimization, screen, keyboard ect not so much on the raw power of the machine.

There are things about the Samsung UI that just feels like it's not that well thought out and unfinished:

-The folders not resizing to the number of apps you have in it.

-The icons in the folders not filling out the folder icon.

-The app drawer not resetting back to page one when you leave the app drawer.

-When you delete all apps/widgets from a home screen and it's completely empty, it doesn't auto delete, so you'll have a home page that's just sitting there empty.

-When sorting apps in the app drawer in alphabetical order, folders are always at the front even if I rename them to 'Z'.

-When I'm in an app and swipe up to get the multi tasking menu, it will move away from the current app and go to a previous app. But when I'm on the phone screen and swipe up to the multitasking menu, it'll go directly to the last app I used and not to the left. It's inconsistent behaviour.

-For work profiles, it won't let you change keyboards. I don't want Samsung's keyboards but can't swap to any other.

-Certain apps open with half the screen wasted. For example, Google Messages, when I open the app, I only start seeing messages half way down the screen and the top half is empty.

Then there's just the usual smoothness of it which isn't as smooth as the Pixel to me. Pixel has nicer, smoother animations and like design cues that to me are more polished. The large icons in the notification shade on the Pixel I thought were a waste of space, but then I grew to appreciate them and now that I'm back on Samsung, I prefer the larger notification shade icons of the Pixel. 

It's just a preference thing, but coming back to Samsung, I do like the Pixel UI a lot more.";0

I don't know if it's because I'm not using Bixby or whatever, but damn! Noticably better than before. S23 user BTW. I also turned off RAM Plus. The only reason I used Bixby was because I could use my voice to set reminders which is very important for work, but now Google has Tasks integrated with Google assistant. Bixby is not a bad assistant, but maybe it clutters and bogs down the system, who knows. It's been two days and for someone that notices micro stutters, I've seen none.;0

2012;14szxry;G3mipl4fy;1688763158.0;It's literally the worst distro of android I've been using. Some of my quick access actions are hard to reach, poor gestures, lacking personalization.

2013;14szxry;Altruistic_Extent_89;1688766328.0;I like oneUI, but the bloatware kills me. When I bought my S22 ultra\* for more than the vast majority of phones cost, I expected a premium product.

Then go through app permissions to remove the file and phone access permissions of apps that had no business needing access to those things. Then, finally it felt like a nice phone.;0
2014;14szxry;pirateninjamonkey;1688766586.0;It's not true though.  With stock android you can change the UI to basically whatever.;0

2031;14szxry;Competitive_Ad1248;1688865257.0;"One UI is fine as a front end UI for the system as a whole. As a launcher, it lacks a lot for me. I still use Nova and have for a decade. 

I see a lot of comments regarding the galaxy store, does anyone actually use it for any reason other than updating Samsung's applications? Honestly they should just integrate the required apps and have them remain up to date. I don't think I've ever installed anything other than the epic games engine and Fortnite from the galaxy store. Besides watch themes.

I've been with Samsung for a very long time, took a short break when the first pixel device launched. Samsung just does hardware right and thankfully their software has caught up in a lot of ways. I'm excited to see what one UI comes up with in future iterations.";0

What I meant is that Google is moving away from having stock colors and setting the theming based on your wallpaper. You can disable the color choosing but you can't disable material you on Pixel phones. And even the basic stock material you color doesn't look that great.

And if I try to report some minor UI/UX bug with Samsung Members app.... Oh my gosh that support is so useless. Totally useless.

General customizations in OneUI are deeper, with GoodLuck they are absolutely unmatched. My favorite modules are Home Up to change up some stuff, including the Recents screen and how it behaves and QuickStar to change up the Quick Panel menu.

I'll still choose the s23u over the pixel 7 pro for its incredible hardware and longer software support.

2132;14tvn8s;blujay40;1688816595.0;"Well, I own and still use both a Note 8 and Note 10+.  Can't speak for what other's experience may be but here's mine.

I took out both S Pen's and they appear to be the same size, shape, etc.  I then inserted each into the opposite phone and although both went into the slot without issues and each recognized the other's S Pen upon insertion, neither would ""lock"" up into the slot so the the end of the S Pen was flush with the outer band.  The flat end/nub stuck out just enough on both so one could get a fingernail behind it and easily pull it out with almost no resistance where when each is in their proper device, the flat end/nub was flush with the outer band and I couldn't get a nail or anything else in there to try and pull it out without the normal push/pull process.

So although it appears that the 10+ S pen will ""work"" with the Note 8 in a functional manner (and vise versa), the S Pen end sticking out just enough to get a nail behind it also would most likely be an issue in a pocket, purse, etc., where something could catch the end of the S Pen and easily pull it out.

I bought my mom a 2020 moto g and that thing seems sluggish and the resolution isn’t crisp but if you look at the numbers you’d think wow it stomps out the original moto g. As the numbers raised so did the resources android needed. I bought an old htc one m8 for nostalgia recently and that thing is crisp and slow looking because I’m used to 120hz displays.

2238;14t13ab;_marcoos;1688777493.0;">how do I know which is a flagship

By the letter in the model name.

* Z series - flagship foldables, international; currently: Z Fold 4, Z Flip 4
* W series - flagship foldables for the People's Republic of China; an almost exact clone of the Z series, but with software adjusted to match what the Communist Party wants; some additional bling added. Current models: W23 (Z Fold 4 equivalent), W23 Flip (Z Flip 4 equivalent);
* S series - flagship slab phones, currently: S23/S23+/S23 Ultra; except:
* S FE (previously S Lite) series - ""flagship killers"", how much they differ from the same-numbered flagship S models varies (the most recent model of this series is the S21 FE, which is literally just a slightly smaller S21+; but the upcoming S23 FE is rumored to be much worse than any of the real S23s and based on what appears to be the internals of a European Exynos-based S22)
* A series - from totally low-end devices (A0x Core, A0x)  via lower-midrange (A1x, A2x, A3x) to upper-midrange (A5x/A7x), current models are A04 Core/A04/A04s/A14/A24/A34/A54. The higher the first digit is, the better.
* M series - take an A series model, possibly put a bigger battery in it (but not always), do some random minor changes to it, put less care about the build quality, the result is an M series. The caveat is: M series software support timespan is much shorter than in the A series. The original idea here was to have cheap phones only sold online (Xiaomi-style), but you can get them in physical shops now too, so I'm not really sure why this line-up exists at all.FWIW, the M54 seems to be a better device than the A54 (if you ignore the shorter support timespan).
* F series - basically, selected M series models but sold by Flipkart in India.

Any other single letters in the model name (e.g. ""Galaxy J"") are deprecated.

There's also the XCover line-up, which is like an upper midrange A series, but rugged.

Basically, anything that isn't a Z, a W nor an S is either a mid-range or low-end device.";0
2239;14t13ab;KidKitzman;1688832814.0;I just replaced my S9, but it's still quite reliable and probably faster than half of the phones I sell. The main reason I even replaced it is because the battery dies much faster than it used to. Sure, the Z Fold 3 I got is much faster, but the S9 is still completely competent in today's environment. Very glad I went with Samsung.;0
2240;14t13ab;giaphox;1688750148.0;Same. From a fellow N20U user, I love my phone so much, the camera is amazing in almost every way, except the zooming, but that's ok.;0
2241;14t13ab;Dafiro93;1688736513.0;I wouldn't call the A13 a mid tier, that's more like entry tier.  A mid tier would be something like the A54 which costs a bit over $400 and actually has pretty good performance for the price.;0
2242;14t13ab;landonloco;1688751496.0;Yeah A13 is pretty low end phone pretty much a phone you give your none Tech savvy grandmother lol.;0
2243;14t13ab;Swagigi;1688794139.0;well it's not even mid tier, it's low tier. The A32 is pretty good for low end (my aunt loves hers) but my a12 sucked after a month, the A54 does a lot of stuff the s23 does for a couple hundred less, comparison matters.;0

2303;14taedd;beserker15;1688746148.0;Don't use a lens protector. Typically you won't notice any quality drop off, but lens flare, glare, sun rays become more of a thing since you are adding an additional piece of glass on top. Just use a case that offers some camera protection.;0

2314;14ssrq3;Southern-Bad-1270;1688730544.0;Backbone is the controller it's the brand. It's also the only one officially supported by call of duty mobile, but it costs $100. You can probably get the razer kishi v2 or gamesir x2 (gamesir has both a Bluetooth and USB c) for cheaper than the back bone but they aren't officially supported by call of duty mobile, but work for emulation no issues.;0

This year the Galaxy unpacked just takes place at the last days of july, while the last 2 years it has been like in the range of 7-10th of august, so a week earlier now.

u/DumonsterPT is right in the fact that usually the watches officially **release** at the end of august, but I have always preordered the watches, and I got the GW4 and the GW5 a few days after the **announcement.**

So if you live in the USA, you might not get the watch you preordered until almost a month later, at end of august, but rest of the world receives theirs usually a few days after announcement, I am in Europe for example. This has been the case for both the GW4 and GW5, with the new annoucement date now in july, they may have changed it a bit.";0

2331;14su01r;No-Butterfly-992;1688699907.0;"I prefer Samsung Wallet/Pay. Google Wallet/Pay has this thing if your phone is unlocked, you hold it up to a terminal, and Google Wallet/Pay activates automatically (I consider this a huge security risk) with Samsung you have to open the app and either fingerprint or PIN to activate the card to pay, also a 50 second timer is activated after that it deactivates paying

Also, I am in Canada, and my bank is TD Canada Trust (TD Bank Canada), and they only support Apple and Samsung Wallet/Pay";1
2332;14su01r;Thick_Examination520;1688698738.0;"It entirely depends what your social surroundings are. If more people use Google Pay, and more shops prefer Google Pay more than Samsung Pay, you should prefer Google Pay if you are unbiased between both apps.

However, I use Samsung Pay here in India since it is compatible with nearly all the major players and is inbuilt in my phone. There are some reasons for it:

(1.) I noticed reward coins in Samsung Pay much more than that in Google Pay.

(2.) Samsung Pay allows me to add a PayTM wallet inside it. So I don't need to input my Bank PIN whenever I make a transaction.

(3.) Samsung Pay is more battery efficient on Samsung phones. Google apps always run in the background whichever phone you use.

(4.) Samsung Pay allows me to store my important documents within the app, inside Samsung Wallet.

(5.) I can access Samsung Pay using just a swipe-up from bottom of the screen, from any screen, even from lock screen.

These were my honest observations after using nearly all of the payment apps on a Galaxy. My priorities include speed, features and battery life.

2333;14su01r;Jupiter3840;1688706071.0;In Australia, I use Google Wallet as my Transport card only works through that. Plus I found Google Pay worked far more reliably than Samsung Pay when they originally came out.;0

Also, with regards to performance not really since they all perform about the same in day to day and are snappy enough for your requirements. Cameras are deffinitely better than a54 but the touch issues trump that. S22 has bad ish battery life but imo still decent and you can fins it in the 500 600 price range.";0
2430;14spjk6;MusaaKhan;1688807202.0;I have the Exynos S21 FE, it's a really good phone and the battery is okayish (I can get 5h of SOT with all the features turned on). From what I've read online the SD 888 and Exynos 2100 are both equally good or bad in the battery department, that can also be said for phone with SD 8 Gen 1. I'd get the S21 FE if I were you honestly. Way better cameras, processor, etc. Only drawback when compared to the A54 would be the battery. And I can also guarantee the phone won't lag or give hiccups down the years and it was also get software updates till 2026-27 (Android 16).;0

2442;14t8xdd;_marcoos;1688776359.0;"Yes and no, that depends on whether your country's carriers are as deranged as (some of?) the American ones and whether they have whitelists/blacklists of devices they support (and consider ""phones"") and not.

If your carriers are not deranged, everything should work fine; tablets and phones conceptually really only differ in the screen size, the internals are the same (of course, bar performance, camera quality and other obvious differences between the Tab A7 Lite and phones like A54 or the S/Z series).

The (Samsung) Phone app is there and works fine, both with incoming and outgoing calls. I used to make some calls from my S7 FE, it went fine. You can also install Google's variant of that if you prefer that. Same with both companies Messages apps.

What will not work:

* Samsung Health, Samsung Health Monitor and the plugin for the Galaxy Watch will not show up in the Play Store nor in the Galaxy Store (because Samsung believes you shouldn't pair a watch with a tablet). You may try sideloading them, but I'm not sure if that'll work.  
Not sure how other health trackers and smart watch integration apps work with a tablet, I've only ever had a GW.
* Samsung Themes don't work on tablets because Samsung doesn't want them to
* You may potentially have problems with banking apps. Here in Poland some banks ban their apps from what they consider tablets. Your bank in Brazil may do so, or not, your mileage may vary, I have no way of telling that.

So, assuming your carrier doesn't ban the Tab A7 Lite, it will generally work as a phone for you. Just with some apps possibly being unavailable due to bullshit reasons.";0

I've contacted Samsung support about this and their recommendation was to reset the device, which I don't believe is going to help. Everything else is working, all diagnostic tests pass, and the problem does not occur if connected to the phone by BT or on WiFi. Speedtest on LTE results show 8Mb+ which should be plenty for 64Kbps audio streams.

iHeart app buffers heavily for several minutes and eventually levels out, but changing to a different station starts it over and usually crashes the app, requiring it or the watch to be restarted. MP3 streams launched from the Internet browser stop working as soon as the screen dims, and turning AOD on does not help.

- my phone is an S21 and I've just installed an update today (but it still does not work). 

- I've cleared the data/cache from smartthings and reinstalled the app. 
- I've reset the network settings several times on my phone.
- I've done the same to my family member's phone as we shared the tags.
- The smartthings app is entirely on my phone now as their phone is an old s7. 
- all of the tags were added to my phone first before I shared them with my family member. 
- I've pressed the button and added the batteries and held etc many times. 
- I've even bought new batteries and tried with all three tags. 

- the error message does change. It was initially the 04-201 error message that there is a problem with its Bluetooth information. But today when I tried the message had reverted to ""another person has already added this tag to smartthings. To use this tag, the other person needs to remove it from their smartthings app first"".

Thanks for your help,";0

It says ""bypassing""  
And also read this 

 ""p **ower is delivered to system**  **and physical battery charging is minimized.** ""  
so it doesnt mean that power go through battery and then go to chipset.  
It means that power directly go to system, ofc it could send some small energy to the battery controller because battery need deliver power to system if you suddently unplug the cable I guess.  
One thing that sustains the theory that is a bypass , its the necessity to have a PD cable, because technically it is possible to pause charging with any cable, since the first android phone, because when it goes to 100% it's already stop charging the battery.  


I've done some tests with the option enabled and the heat was so minimal that you could say the battery is not being used.   
but if you let your phone charge to 100% and use it on gaming u will see the heat increasing, because it uses directly the battery and the charge feed the battery so its charging/discharging at same time";0

That said in the real world, i seen so many people  going around with a s20, note 10, s9 iphone 5, and as far back as a s6 completely content with no issues.

Realistically is it a security risk? Of course. But again, in the real world most people just don't care about software updates like us techies do. I used a crappy midrange 2016 samsung phone up till 2020 until I had wanted a upgrade.

If you treat your phone the same way you'd treat a computer, use a good vpn, and dont do anything dumb, you will probably be fine. Still a risk of course but it's what you make of it.";0

Happened to my Rog Phone 2 while I was playing cod about 4-5 months in. This one was a nightmare and I sold it off as soon as I got it back fixed because it took 11 weeks to fix it and I had to send it interstate. Phone was unusable as it bricked itself. 

All motherboard issues.";0
2562;14sdho3;bopthoughts;1688684566.0;I've never had any hardware failures with my s5, s10, s22 and s23+. Unlike LG, which all ended up in a bootloop (L80, G4 Stylus, G5, V20);0
2563;14sdho3;Citizen_V;1688684720.0;"I was in a similar situation. Both my S8 and S22 died because of motherboard related problems.

My S8 died suddenly because of a 'motherboard' failure. It *was* after 4.5 years but I've also had other phones that outlasted it. When I took it to uBreakiFix, they already had a guess about what happened because they saw several other S8s with the same issue. It was likely a PMIC related issue, something a lot of people also reported on Reddit ([example 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/mobilerepair/comments/i3m5mk/dead_samsung_galaxy_s8/), [example 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS8/comments/fhgjcy/s8s_motherboard_failed/), [example 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS8/comments/wimrdg/galaxy_s8_wont_turn_back_on/)). uBreakiFix couldn't fix it and said Samsung would just replace the entire motherboard. It wasn't worth the cost for a 5 year old phone, so I bought a S22.

My S22 also died because of a motherboard failure after 4 months of use, and was replaced under warranty. This time it was a slow death, where my phone was occasionally crash. This happened for several days in a row, and I thought it was just a misbehaving app. Eventually it corrupted Android and I couldn't boot my phone. Samsung replaced the motherboard and also the sub PBA for the charging port. I presume the latter had an issue as well, but I didn't notice it.

Despite that, I still own an S23 and I'm not too worried. Hardware failures occur and I may have just been unlucky.";0

2684;14s6ifl;KKMasterYT;1688665416.0;It really doesn't matter. Well, you're on Reddit. It's still the best Launcher on the market in terms of customisation.;0
2685;14s6ifl;Citizen_V;1688674741.0;I'd agree there isn't a huge *need* for 3rd party launchers, but they're still useful for those who are into personalization of their phones.

2694;14s6ifl;Blanc_N0ir;1688646637.0;"- no need to reopen after reboot as long as you set it as a default launcher. 

- same answer as above. As long as you set it as default launcher, you don't need to open it like an app. It won't go back to OneUI if you press home or back button. 

- no, it doesn't drain an extra battery. It doesn't show up in battery devicecare.";1
2695;14s6ifl;Gato_L0c0;1688662423.0;Sounds like you haven't set Nova as the default launcher.;0
2696;14s6ifl;notsoawesome1593;1688692683.0;nah it can be set as default home button and at boot opens any default launcher and as for drain a bit for maybe like 30% more drain compared to normal UI but that's not much more if regular drains .4% the third party maybe .6 it depends on the launcher;1

I should give it a try as well. I'm using Niagara now and it's okay, but I don't love it. The idea of a minimalistic launcher was appealing at first, but I found it to be too limiting.

2704;14szkyb;batmonkey7;1688730006.0;"Honestly, the best bet is to put them on the phone itself. But there are other options.

Option 1) On the phone

50GB is music is about 12,000 songs, which is about 14 hours of music...

That's plenty and still leaves you room on the phone, especially if you get the 256 model.

You could then simply swap what music you have over time.

Option 2) streaming

It is relatively cheap depending on your none wifi data usage and how much data you get. It's honestly doesn't use much data to stream songs, and I doubt it would all be cellular data and not WiFi anyway.

Option 3) by a note 20 ultra

Slightly older device but will be cheap enough and has an sd card slot. No ultra phone since have had an sd card slot.";0

2707;14szkyb;Generalrossa;1688781756.0;"Kind of a solution but you can get a USBC card reader and plug it into your phones port and access your music from there.

Or ultimately you could go cloud storage. 

The alternative to Samsung is to get a Sony flagship which still has the jack and SD slot. Or like another person said, get the A54 although it's not a flagship.

Also you could just get another S20 if you're happy with that and most likely the cheapest solution.";0

2721;14sgf6x;KentuckyHouse;1688694535.0;">It does the same thing as call screening on Pixel phones.

Not quite. 

It works great if you're not using the phone and a call comes in. Just tap the Bixby Call button, swipe up, and you're good. 

But unlike the Call Screen on the Pixel, it's manual only, meaning you have to invoke it yourself, whereas the Pixel can intercept calls automatically and route them where they need to go. 

And the biggest difference, for me at least, is that Bixby Call isn't available when the phone's connected to Android Auto. Because the call comes through the head unit, you don't have the option of screening the call. The same goes for the Pixel, but it can still work automatically in the background. 

Don't get me wrong, Bixby Call is a great addition, but I'd like to see them add an auto function where you don't have to invoke it manually.";0
2722;14sgf6x;bobbymack93;1688728174.0;Yeah, I just switched over to a pixel fold and have google assistant screen the calls for me it is so nice, and do wish Samsung would allow the same.

If you’re looking to make a comparison between just content consumption screens, a base iPad with a 10.9” screen starts at $449. Compared to the budget 50” QLED TV (assuming you’re looking at the Q60A), the iPad Pro 12.9” will have a much nicer screen, with a MicroLED backlight (2596 dimming zones vs none) offering much better HDR performance (1600 nits peak vs 500 nits peak), alongside higher refresh rate (120Hz vs 60Hz), better colour coverage (99% vs 92% DCI-P3 coverage), and contrast (1,000,000:1 vs 4600:1).

2778;14snssa;RareSiren292;1688717731.0;Well devices aren't priced based off the screen size. Screen technology, processor, and you know what the device actually is and does. A cheap ish tv screen quality isn't close to the ipad pro. A edge lit poor contrast tv vs a mini led with over 2500 dimming zones and a 1 million to 1 contrast ratio condensed in a 12.9 inch package. Which one do you think took more R&D and costs more to make? The ipad pro also has a laptop processor, SSD storage, ram, oh and the screen is touch. Vs a TV? How does it not make sense why the the ipad is more expensive?;0

One (TV) is about how epic the detail is, how powerful how bright etc etc etc. The other (tablet) is about how large it is for a PORTABLE device... Aka not plugged in 24/7 but dropped into a bag...

 Also people can download Google Meets for you EVERYONE who has a YouTube or Gmail account Automatically has a Google Meets account it doesn't matter if your an iphone user so all you need to do is sign into the app itself.

You're not looking at this from the other side perspective. If you are in a group of 10 friends and you're the only one not using an iPhone, you're asking 9 people to change their ways just for you, everyone else they talk to, they would use a different app.

It's the same as someone coming to you right now telling you and all of your friends and family to use iMessage instead of Whatsapp to talk to them, just one person.... 

Yes it sucks, but it's completely understandable. It's not a 1 to 1 thing it's a 1 to many thing and asking a bunch of people to bend backwards to satisfy one person is silly.

The 50% of android users in the US either don't care, or have enough relatives/friends that are in the same boat and use a different app.

Apple is fixing this for their users anyway. Picture/video is going to be sent via iMessage for everyone with an iPhone in a group thread with an android phone, so the high res will not be an issue for them anymore.

I hated the ui of my s6 but I could change launchers for a better experience. It didn't fix the horrible battery life but at least it was something I controlled. You can change the software but you can't change the hardware.;0

3190;14rdt1r;glum_hedgehog;1688599323.0;"A51 changed how I feel about Samsung and not for the better. I had one and actually loved it at first, but it barely lasted a year before it started going into a spiral of nonstop freezing/restarting. Just over and over and over with no way to stop it, every single time you'd try to use it. It never had issues until one day when it did an update, then suddenly it wouldn't stay on for more than 2 minutes without starting the freeze/restart cycle. 

Apparently that was a known problem with the A series phones, there are dozens of posts on the Samsung forum about it. Contacted Samsung and they were zero help, did not give one single F even though it's a widespread issue on their end and clearly not user error. They basically told me to go kick rocks.

I had a Galaxy J7 before that, which lasted for 5 years and probably would have lasted at least 2 more, so I was shocked at how bad the A51 let me down. I have an S21 right now while I save up for an iPhone.";0

By this, I mean for apple things will usually be a bit more coherent among all its systems as everything is integrated by the same company, what they see as best is what you get  but they make every bit to look in their taste and disregard anything they see as ""superfluous for the masses things"". 

On the other hand with samsung you have the quality things that likely work for everyone along with superfluous fun things that people may like (samsung dex that I can swear saved me at work a few times for example, the 10x optical zoom camera, all android customization, etc), plus being android its easier to add and remove bits from it, but it's not as optimised as while samsung integrates directly for its devices google integrates for the widest range possible so the base of gapps and similar will be far less efficient than apple apps or huawei apps you find in the other mobile OSs.

For me all the opportunities damsung offers beat apple's, but it's really a matter of preference, plus both have awesome horizontal device integration, so I you go fully with one brand (earphones, phone, watch, tracker and even possibly adding computer and tablet) you'll have a great time";0

It doesn't need charging unless you wanna use the features that need bluetooth.

Downside- Android apps are not made for tablets unlike most IOS apps. Only a few apps will work properly and take advantage of the large screen.

IMO Samsung's UI has a lot of features but isn't as smooth or well animated as iOS or stock android. Pixels take great photos and have essentially no bloat ware and some pretty neat software tricks that make it smarter than other phones. OnePlus and Xiaomi have software closer to iPhone and offer some unique features such as super fast charging and what not. Samsung is sort of your power users phone with endless features and customization but if you care for a polished, nuanced, or consistent experience it's not the best out there. Considering you mentioned your GF uses Samsung you probably are able to test hers out. Consumers in the US tend to default to Samsung as the android but there are tons of other great or maybe better options for you if you look into it.

The downside is that well you are using an IPhone. If you want to add other devices that aren’t compatible with IOS then you are out of luck. Customisation is also lacking a few paces behind the competition and lack of features such as periscope camera or USB-C until the new 15 comes out.";0

3436;14rlrg4;smokeymeowmeow;1688624948.0;"I just bought a 360 pro 3, mainly to draw on Clip StudioPaint and Photoshop. So the touchscreen is a major draw for me. The laptop is really light, feels even lighter than a MacBook Pro. Battery is great, lasts a long time, charges quickly too. I dislike that the battery isn't easy to take out if or when I needed to replace it. The S pen is very light and has a great range of pressure sensitivity. My S23u s pen works with the laptop too. I'm peeved that there's no way to store the S pen inside the laptop so I have to be careful not to lose it.

As for Samsung apps....

Quickshare has been pretty easy to use and makes transferring files from my phone to the laptop (and vice versa) soooo much easier.

I also use Smart Things on the laptop to turn on/off smart lights and configure various other things without having to pick up my phone. 

I haven't tried Bixby on the laptop, so no comment. 

For texting, I use Phone link. That can be installed on any Windows device.

Overall, I really like 1the 360 Pro 3. The samsung shared features with phone to laptop made things more convenient for me. Transferring files being the biggest one.";0

I kinda like the oneUI icons, couldn't find any good minimalist icon pack.";0
3625;14qj5xf;mbpunjabi;1688630091.0;"Hello!

I setup my home screen so it could help in accessing a lot of stuff without having to stretch my small hands over this tall screen :D The goal was to have everything accessible from the bottom half of the screen with minimal navigation

I can access 22 apps and 10 quick settings from the bottom half, I call that a win.

If you like my setup, here's a guide below

**Wallpaper**: *Wolverine Claws* \- got it from Google

**Launcher**: *Nova Launcher Prime*

**Icons:** Flat White, Lines, LineX White

**Apps & Folders**

I got the Camera, Gallery, Browser, Messaging, Phone, Contacts apps here.Along with those I have 6 folders setup - Google, Media, Shopping, Office, Social and Samsung - swiping up or down on each folder opens up an app of its own (for e.g. swipe up on the Social folder opens Facebook - swipe down opens Instagram)

**Widgets**: *KWGT Pro*

They come in from KWGT Pro and packs called Vanilla & Flow within the appI customized the Calendar and Time+Weather widgets from these apps (you can do that within KWGT) to suit my style more

The bottom right is just a text widget I created within KWGT showing my username.

I have set a shortcut within KWGT for these widgets - tapping on the time, date & weather areas open up the clock, calendar and weather apps respectively, whereas tapping on the username widget opens settings.

**Quick Tools:** *One Hand Operation+* (You'd need to download Good Lock from Samsung Store or Nice Lock from the web depending on your region)

I have put a toggle handle on the bottom right of the screen, swiping left downwards from it opens up the quick tools area

I have pretty much set it to everything the regular panel allows me to do, there's also a button to bring down the regular panel. The only thing it doesnt show is the location toggle - I still haven't figured out a way to include that.

While the UX took around a couple of days to get used to, I simply cannot get used to any other phone coz I kind feel spoiled by this.

I set this up on my Note 20 Ultra and now I am using it on my S23 Ultra.

3801;14qst5p;Whole-Brilliant5508;1688533099.0;"I came from an S22+ to an S23+. And, holy cow, I noticed a significant difference in battery life right out of the box. The camera is great obviously but for somebody like myself who plays lots of heavy duty games like Pokemon Go or Genshin Impact and listens to tons of podcasts, music, or YouTube while at work; the battery life has been fantastic and doesn't really heat up all that much to the point it has to shut down thanks to the phone's internal cooling system. I can even take my phone to Disneyland or a convention like San Diego Comic-Con for a whole day and it will be able to get through the entire day. Even set to Power Saving mode, the phone is still pretty snappy and quick. And since the screen is flat, it's easy to find a good tempered glass screen protector. I recommend going with Spigen's tempered glass screen protectors since they work fabulously with the fingerprint reader. I have owned several Samsung phones including the Note series and I think this might be the best phone I have owned to date.";0

3804;14qst5p;__ManBearPig___;1688541950.0;"It's personal preference. I hate the s20 to s22, i bought s23 because it was 400 Euro without a contract through my friend's company. While I hate those 3 phones I still keep my s10 and have been using it 24/7 since launch SD variant.
I admit im from the few that actually prefer a curved screen but s23 is quite enjoyable...tried all uag and spiegen cases but an xtremeskin and a ringke fusion matte and I wont lie I love the s23 as much as the s10. Can live without a heart sensor and my sonys cover the lack of 3.5mm headphone jack. Video is much improved even over s22 and love the new snapdragon and battery autonomy. My only gripe is that you need to use alot of custom settings to get the camera to the needed level but autofocus issue is waaay better. But all and all i would take it over s20 to s22.

EDIT. Forgot to mention that no phone is a slauch. My S10 SD is literally as fast as the s23 even though 60hz. I ve never once experienced lag or slowdown in 4 and a half years and im a power uaer and do 10 hrs onscreen time a day sometimes 14. As I said the only reason i upgraded at first was the great deal but im still happy for the fresh battery and better display.

Presently, there are a number of disadvantages to getting the S23+ :

Besides giving up your SD card storage (up to 1 TB), You will also be giving up your 12 GB of RAM.

The S23+ is shorter in size than the S20+... 

The screen resolution is less on the S23+;  2340x1080 vs 3200x1440;

I'm pretty sure the new gorilla Glass on the S23+ is easier to put micro scratches into... Would need to make sure you have a screen protector covering your glass.

I presently have the S20+ Snapdragon and I'm waiting to see what the s24 brings... There's nothing compelling at all about the S23+...  And although the S23 Ultra has the added zoom it will be too heavy/big for most users.";0

Tell me as the owner of an S20+, what is the compelling reason to go over to an S23+.  There aren't really any strong compelling reasons to make the swap... As I mentioned above, I actually give up items by upgrading to Samsung's newest/best device. 

I can easily wait an additional 6 months to find out what the s24 is going to have.  Or I can switch to another maker such as Sony if I desire. One thing is for sure, there is nothing compelling with the new S23 series to get me to upgrade from the S20+ to the S23+... nothing at all!";0

When the S22 Ultra came out I decided to switch and regretted it. The battery life was poor and the performance was sub par. It would hang apps, I had to force reset every few days etc. I was going to go back to apple until 23 series came out and the two biggest upgrades were battery and performance. This is the first android device I've ever used that I can say is just as fast as my apple devices. Zero lag or hic ups, I've never had to force reset or anything. And the battery life is amazing. For some people they don't mind hiccups with their device and can always get to a charger so it may not matter as much to everyone, but mattered a lot for me.;0

Like I said, first android phone that I can say that about. I don't know however if after a year or two that performance will decrease noticably. I upgrade more often than I should so I don't think that it will make a difference to me and I'm very happy with my phone, but if I was looking to buy a phone that I will use for the next 3-5 years I still would probably buy an iPhone instead.;0

3847;14qst5p;ChristmasCactus49;1688586083.0;How are battery life and performance irrelevant? Is it irrelevant if they couldn't get through a full work day without charging, and now they can?

3848;14qst5p;SnooOranges8783;1688583781.0;Right on. I'm just amazed because the size of s23 and 3900mah. Very efficient.;0

Btw my S20+ runs with no hiccups at all... it's as smooth as can be! Maybe that has to do with the fact that my phone has 12gb of RAM compared to what Samsung is now pushing out as ""acceptable"" in the S23+... only 8gb of RAM. I guess they didn't really take that away... 😕

Plus my resolution in my old S20+ is better than the new and improved resolution in the S23+... that's just a fact, but you and Samsung would probably consider that to be not terribly important... and something that was not taken away by Samsung... ☹️

And less than a 5% increase in battery size, 4700 mah vs 4500 mah, is nothing to get too excited about. My battery life works just fine for my needs.  

Hopefully Samsung gets their act together and makes some ""meaningful changes"" in the s24+ and give back what they have taken away from plus series users so that people find  reasons to make the upgrade investment... Or if not, consumers will probably consider other brands such as Sony which still provides the SD card slot...

I have a phone that works amazing in any other regard, a Samsung Galaxy. But for some reason, ever since I bought it, this phone refuses to connect to the internet in my home. Or, no, it connects to the WiFi just fine, and there is a spike of about 15 seconds where the internet works... and then it stops working. It stays connected to my home WiFi, but with no internet data coming through.

I feel like I have tried everything. Initially I thought it was a router issue and bought another router, but no, the issue is the same no matter what router I use. 

Then I thought, maybe the network is to blame? Except all my other gadgets and devices use the high-speed internet just fine, and when I have guests over, their phones connect to my WiFi perfectly fine, so there's no problem with the internet provider.

Then I finally thought, maybe my phone's WiFi hardware is broken, after all, the issue is obviously within the phone and not the network. Except, and get this - it connects perfectly to all other WiFi networks. You name it: other people's home networks, McDonald's wifi, airplane wifi, etc.

So for some reason, my Samsung Galaxy, ever since I bought it, just cannot use my home WiFi internet for more than 15 seconds (and the funny thing is, if I disconnect, then reconnect, I get those 15 seconds of high-speed wifi each time I connect - so it's obviously a Samsung software bug).

## AIR FRYER VS CONVECTION OVEN

An air fryer can be thought of as a sort of mini convection oven. Both appliances use a fan to circulate heated air throughout the cooking cavity. An air fryer or a countertop oven on the air fry setting usually circulates the air a bit faster than in a convection oven. This can sometimes give you a crispier finish that is just a bit closer to an actual deep fried finish, depending on your recipe.

A convection oven has the same advantages over an air fryer as a regular oven—size. If you’re making multiple dishes or batches at once, a convection oven can help prepare it all at once. But if you’re simply preparing one pan of crispy fried cauliflower, an air fryer is just the right size and can save you the time of heating an entire oven. 

For maximum flexibility, why not have both? Use your air fryer or countertop oven for single batches and your convection oven for bigger jobs. Having the additional countertop options is also helpful for when you’re preparing dishes with different cooking needs. Air fry some appetizers in your countertop oven while you slow-roast your entree in the convection oven. Lean more about [how a convection oven works](https://www.kitchenaid.com/pinch-of-help/major-appliances/what-is-convection-oven-baking-cooking.html) and how to use it.";0

Really though, my Mom's had this issue. Some robo call spam/phishing/scam whatever used ""cloned"" her caller ID. She was getting all kinds of irate calls from a neighboring area code, ""why are you calling me"" etc. She was distraught for a bit (she's in her 70's). Finally died down after a bit. Too a couple moths. She doesn't use her phone much so it wasn't as bad as it would likely be for someone who relies on their phone and number.

I've had a few calls where some said ""I got a call from this number?"" when I didn't call them. Only a few over several years but it;s weird. Not sure if it's an occasional ""clone"" or if maybe caller ID can screw up on occasion.

For a while I kept getting calls from my area code AND prefix. Scammers would grab a number with that beginning and call all the other numbers. SO when you look you think it's a ""local"" call. Thankfully that stopped a couple years ago.";0

I'd say 6.1 inches of screen is the perfect spot, not too big and not too small. The small battery can surprisingly last a day for such a powerful beast. Cameras are actually pretty good, both in daylight and night shots. I'd say this is one of the most underrated phones of the year.;0
4350;14pjvc2;Arcaneus_Umbra;1688442151.0;I just got the A54, basically a S23 without some features. Seems pretty good to me;0

The only problem was my presbyopia, so I was forced to switch to an Ultra some days ago, but the 899€ price and the 300€ cashback helped a lot.";0

4354;14pjvc2;Luneticben;1688401600.0;6.1 inch is perfect for mobile phones in my opinion. Holding a 6.8 inch mobile phone felt like I was holding a brick. It was too big.;0
4355;14pjvc2;Luneticben;1688401322.0;"I would say change the refresh rate from 120 to 60hz it helps a little bit to save battery. I did it on my dad's phone (S20fe 5g) and it helped.

Also I changed the network from 5g to 4g, it helped!!

If you keep your always on display throughout the night it also drains the battery. I think there is an option to schedule the always on display";0

You can add up to 4 fingerprints. And it's possible to save the same finger multiple times, which sometimes 
helps when using a screen protector (depending on brand/model). 
I personally do both thumbs twice, once in portrait mode and once in landscape mode.

If you try it, please let me know if it helped or not!

Edit: there's also a dedicated setting to increase the sensibility of the sensor when using a protector.";0

4360;14pjvc2;Poux3;1688449133.0;Very well, usually a full charge is enough for a day of work (wake up at 7 and go to bed at 12am) with around 5h of sot. If I have to go out in the evening i just plug it for 10 min to get back to 35/40% and it will last me for the whole night;1
4361;14pjvc2;pierluigir;1688566884.0;July 2nd I reached 9 hours SOT in 5G. Unbelievable;0
4362;14pjvc2;hyo_coconut;1688448485.0;Indeed 6.1 inch is a great size for phones. Maybe people with large hands would like the bigger models for more screen estate. But 6.1 suits me fine :-) I have moderately sized hands.;0

Currently sitting at 71% with 1 hour 12 minutes sceen on time, 3 hours 30 minutes of screen off time. At home, low brightness, 5g and around 2 hours of using the device as a router.

4399;14phqpk;Hasman30;1688467580.0;It's possible that after you transferred everything over to the new phone, it was maybe backing up and restoring data at the same time and also maybe the phone had gotten hotter using more processing power during all the transfer of data.

My phone especially on WiFi tends to eat up battery because of my Google photos constantly backing up new photos I've taken etc. Mines s22 ultra though so battery life isn't amazing.;0

4432;14phqpk;Generalrossa;1688427535.0;"To me, as long as your battery is lasting you all day. Getting the same SOT as others have posted is near impossible as it's based on their usage vs yours and other contributing factors such as are they on WiFi at home all day with low brightness streaming YT. If you want comparable battery life to theirs then watch more YT lol. 

Waze + music streaming + 70% brightness + mobile data = 15% per hour. That sounds pretty good. I'm not too familiar with waze but isn't that a navigation app similar to maps?

Don't compare to other phones, specifically iphones. They are built differently with less features but a much more optimised software + hardware. Iphones will always get better battery life. My 13PM would get 2 hours more SOT compared to my S23U but in exchange the S23U is much, much more of a phone.";0

4442;14phqpk;sinto03;1688638283.0;Yeah, though it still drains battery. If you have it on when you sleep, and you get a notification, it will essentialy be on all the time. So yeah, turn it off when you go to bed is your best go.;0

I mostly use reddit, youtube, youtube music, spotify, whatsapp, and sometime instagram or tiktok. Of course I use other apps to, but those would be the most used during a regular weekday.";0
4445;14phqpk;sinto03;1688852656.0;"Yeah I guess I am a similar user to some extent. I have to say, the battery has been pretty insane the last few days. Last charge has given me 8hrs 8min of SoT and I am still using my phone, sitting at 16% rn, gonna play some games now and see how long it will last.

But what I have reaally been loving, is the fact that if I see my phone being on like 30% or mid 20%, I am not worried that it'll die if I go out to see some friends or something. I obviously am not using my phone during that time when I am out, but the battery barely drains. I was out for 5 hours and I drained like 5-7% since I used it for Instagram and a game. Definitely seeing an improvement after a few days.

4455;14puf26;Jitmaster;1688423075.0;"I tried to run an AI on an old laptop. The result is that the responses came back one word at a time very slowly.  The reason is that newer laptops have newer processors that have newer instructions, which have better SIMD(single instruction multiple data) instructions.  Since the code is simulating neurons, this allows more neurons to be processed in a single instruction cycle.  In other words, the AI can think faster.  So it all depends on how much AI you do and whether you want it to be fast.

I'm not sure if TOPS is a measure of those SIMD instructions or just regular instructions.";0
4456;14puf26;landonloco;1688423602.0;AI just helps in the SOC case to process data faster and more efficiently but it's use would be beneficial depending on what you do if photography and video then a SOC with dedicated chip to process that might be more beneficial I say might Cuz there other things at play like UI  and app optimizations and what not. On paper is better to have more but it's doesn't mean those particular tasks are gonna be faster or better with an AI dedicated cores which is what mobile SOC manufacturers are doing dedicated cores to better process certain stuff people do a lot on their phones like take pictures and videos.

If your S9's battery is dying, and if you really care about the new features that the newer OneUIs provide, I would really invest in an S series phone, or get a better A series, like the A54. The A54's chipset is really energy efficient compared to the Exynos 9810, and provides slightly, but noticeable improvements to performance as it has newer software and optimizations.

- The higher the brightness, the more battery it uses.

- The worse the wireless signal is, the more the phone will have to turn the transmit power up / add more error correction data / retransmit.

- While the phone is idle, charging and fully charged, Android optimizes apps with advanced optimizations based on how you use your apps, and these take effect for an app after said app is relaunched. Updates revert apps to basic optimizations. So, after an update, battery life may improve later. Source:  https://source.android.com/devices/tech/dalvik/configure";0

There's more than bands. e.g. 1\. The ability to make and receive calls on 4G without switching to 3G/2G is not base functionality and requires your phone to support it your carrier specifically. 2\. 5G is not guaranteed regardless of bands. 3\.

i came from the flip 3 but it it had a bad temp sensor and if i folded it less than 80 degrees, temp too low or too high sometimes, it would shut the phone down so i basically had a candy bar phone with a plastic screen(i also took off the screen protector), that meant the soft screen was exposed to my pockets and desk and whatever

ran it for about 8 months being rough with it cause i am frustrated with it now, and boy does it still look pristine with only a couple deep scratches(i aint counting the dent it has due to my younger brother biting it tho) and figure if a plastic screen can survive that much abuse, my glass phone should technically survive any scratches i could throw at it";0

I had the screen protector but after three years it cracked, so I decided to remove it and use it without it. After all, the screen protector had no scratches.

Like I said, I don't use any screen protector. I throw or drop my phone all the time and have my phone in my pockets with change, pens, and keys. Not a single scratch or mark anywhere except the back of the clear phone case. And my phone unlocks first try using any of my four added fingers (both thumbs and ring fingers).

I've heard of many users getting micro scratches on their first day's of use while keeping the phone in their pocket, so imagine how it's gonna look like 2 years from now...

I personally applied a tempered glass protector as soon as I removed the display sticker, before even turning on the phone. The application process went so smooth it doesn't even look like there's an extra glass!

Keep in mind you need to research what tempered glass you'll use, as it might hinder the fingerprint sensor performance. So check the reviews and choose accordingly.";0

Like you, I wanted a ""pure"" Android experience and was hesitant to switch initially. The Fold 4 got me curious enough to make the move though, but even then, I eventually moved beyond that for a better camera/battery life.

I think Samsung got the 23U right. No complaints here. It's a solid phone and doesn't get hot like my P6P would sometimes. As a casual photographer, the camera is on par with the Pixel line, as far as I'm concerned. UI is noticeably different, but once I got used to it, I found it slightly more convenient, especially the optional sidebars I have set up.

I do have a ""Samsung"" folder where I dump duplicate apps that I can't uninstall, like the default browser, Samsung messaging app, and Samsung store app. I don't know why they bothered with their own Store app, tbh.";1
4848;14okawc;MTOP2;1688296150.0;"Former Nexus 4, Pixel 2 XL & 5 owner here. Now on the S23U.
Loved my Nexus 4 & Pixel 2 XL, but my Pixel 5 was worse than my friends Pixel 4a.


Pixel 5 main issues:
- I expected to have a similar performance to my Pixel 2 XL. Ya, it was a mid range chip, but it was way slower than my friend's Pixel 4a.
- In the last year, it would overheat (not shut down, but backing up photos was a challenge, kept stopping saying ""device too hot""). 
- The camera performance was inconsistent. The main camera was good most of the time, but the wide angle photos always looked very different than the main camera, and it was terrible in low light.


Things I prefer on the S23U:
- Performance is way way way faster than my Pixel 5.
- The Quick Panel icons are the better. I didn't care when Google switched to the larger pill shape ones.
- S-Pen, surprisingly, I use it a lot. Quick notes, doodling, websites, air gestures, signing documents, write to text, etc.
- Tons of customization and automation that is easy to use/set up. Lock Screen, Good Lock, touch macros, etc.
- Cameras are Fantastic, all cameras take great photos, 8k30p video, 1080p 960 FPS Super-slow-mo, consistent between lenses, 10x optical zoom (30x photos are useable), portrait mode, expert RAW, etc.
- Samsung Eco system. Got a Galaxy Watch, and it integrates well with my phone and can control features between the two (Theatre mode, sleep, etc)
- Samsung Health. Had FitBit before, and I hated that they put a bunch of data/info behind a paywall.
- Windows Link (access files and apps on your computer)
- Samsung Dex 
- Most Pixel features are available on Samsung or have a Samsung equivalent.


Pixel features I miss:
- Call screen, I didn't use it that often, but I seemed to help with spam calls. Bixby has a similar feature but haven't use it yet.
- Pixel 5 was the last pixel to have this, but Unlimited Photo/Video uploads. Pixel 6 and newer don't.
- Faster OS updates. While Samsung is getting better, they are usually a month or so behind with updates compared to Google.


I could keep going, but overall, I'm very happy switching to my Samsung S23 Ultra.";0

Nexus 5x > Pixel 3a XL > S22 Ultra > Z Fold 4

I used the Nexus and Pixel from 2016 to 2022, 3 years each. I was never that into smartphones, seemed like such a waste of money when there were a lot more interesting things out there to do and see. However in 2022, I was offered a new job with a big pay raise and started upgrading my quality of life. I spent a lot of time debating Pixel 7 vs. S22U, and I decided to try out the Samsung experience side of things with the caveat that if I didn't like it, I'd trade it in and switch back to Pixel.

Its been an interesting experience switching, and there are definitely merits to both.

**Initial Impressions:**

* One UI has **WAY** more functionality than Pixel Launcher. Like its not even close. Its been a very rare case where I need to do some 'normal' function on my phone and need to go outside of what is already built into One UI. Samsung's software is generally pretty polished. I never really ran into bugs on either of my Google phones, and my experience has been the same with One UI.
* All of the Google services integration is still there on Samsung. I still use Google Lens, GBoard, Drive, Gmail, so on. You can recreate all of that on Samsung with very minimal effort. The one stumbling block was Samsung's Calendar doesn't pull in reminders you set up.
* Some of Samsung's apps I actually prefer over Google's, like Calendar, My Files, and Samsung Notes.

**Things I miss from my Pixel:**

* Camera...its the obvious one, but it's true. The S22's Ultra camera was very good ...but Pixel's is just effortless and far more reliable in getting a better looking image. I've tried putting gcam on my Samsungs but they've been too unstable for me to really want to rely on them. I really should look back into that...
* All of the calling tools. The call menu tree, Hold For Me, Call Screening, they genuinely make an extremely unpleasant and tedious task, a lot more bearable. I very rarely make calls so it doesn't come up much...but when I do? Man do I miss them.
* How light it was. I don't care how much metal and glass a phone is made of, I'm still putting a case on it. And if I'm putting a case on it, might as well make it out of plastic because that handles falls better and is cheaper and lighter. I genuinely dislike how heavy flagship phones are. I dropped my S22 Ultra more times in the first month than I dropped my previous two phones in the last 6 years combined, all directly due to the size and weight.

**Things I don't miss:**

* The latest updates. This isn't to say having them was bad, but I thought I would miss not having a fully up-to-date device. Honestly, I don't even really notice. It's just not a big deal, because Samsung keeps One UI pretty close behind, and also cribs features from both Apple and Google that those two are too 'brand focused' to want to imitate.
* Hardware reliability. Every Google phone I've had has had a hardware flaw. I went through two Nexus 5X's due to a manufacturing defect that caused them to eventually and die unavoidably. My Pixel 3a XL started boot looping, which is what prompted me to look at the S22U.

**Things I appreciate about Samsung:**

* Multitasking. Samsung's multitasking features are just so well done and I use them all the time. Being able to have popup windows, Samsung DeX, the edge panel, they're genuinely helpful to me.
* S-Pen. When I had my S22 Ultra, I used it all the time. It was an effective memory aid for me, since physically writing something would help me remember it better.
* One UI is ACTUALLY BLACK. It always boggled my mind that, at least when I was using it, the Pixel Launcher would not let you set your colors as pure RGB black, so the OLED pixels turn off. One UI's dark mode lets you actually turn it fully black!!
* The displays. I know the new Pixels have better displays, but nothing compares to the ones on flagship Samsungs. The colors, the refresh rate, the responsiveness, they're *sooo* good.
* Customization. I know Android 12 introduced Material You, but Samsung's GoodLock lets you have way more control over everything, if you're into that sort of UI customization. Which I am. TRUE BLACK BACKGROUNDS FTW!!!

**Things I dislike about Samsung:**

* Samsung really wants your money. There are always notifications in Samsung apps or nudges for you to purchase subscriptions or buy things using Samsung's tools. They recreated the wheel so they could get their cut of the pie and build their own ecosystem, and I don't appreciate it. If I wanted that experience, I'd buy an iPhone. Their services are pretty decent, but it gets annoying for someone like me who appreciates open systems.
* The cameras. Can you tell I'm not a fan? The Ultra series zoom is really cool, but otherwise I've consistently preferred how my Pixel 3a's camera performs when I did side-by-side comparisons. The Samsung's pics are higher res, but less real. The lighting and colors are a lot truer to life with the Pixel in almost every show compared to Samsung. The Z Fold 4's cameras are really not good imo. I don't have good luck with them at all.

**Summary:**

Pixel and Samsung have different philosophies in designing their products. Google is trying to make a very refined experience that genuinely makes working with your phone easier and less of a hassle. Taking pictures and communicating with your phone, its main purposes for a modern smartphone, are very simple and work extremely well and without much tinkering on your part to have a good experience.

Samsung wants to give you everything, it wants to be the center of your life, it wants to be something you just cannot live without. And honestly I think it can become that, if you let it. There are a lot of very useful features and integrations built into One UI that give you new capabilities you didn't have before. You may not use all of it, but you might use some of it and those things could become invaluable to you.

That being said, I spend **more** time on my phone with my Samsung than I did with my Pixel. Whether or not you consider that a good or bad thing, or even if you care, is up to you.

**Would I go back:**

I'm open to it, but at the moment, the answer is no. The Pixel Fold is intriguing to me, but there are just a lot of features on One UI that I've come to really appreciate and would sorely miss compared to the Pixel's unique features.

Given unlimited budget, I could see myself getting a Pixel specifically for the cameras. I'm not a photographer and while I understand exposure times and f-stop, I'd rather have a reliably convenient point-and-shoot experience that I just don't get on Samsung. Otherwise I don't call or take enough pictures to make the Pixel exclusive features worth it.";0
4855;14okawc;AliasInvstgtions;1688316263.0;In 2012, I got a cheap android as I was a kid doing odd jobs to have a cellphone and plan (my parents couldn't afford a phone or plan for me), it was an HTC one v. It was pretty bad, as expected of a less than 100 dollar smartphone. Then, I upgraded to another cheap LG, can't remember what it was and then I got another HTC, it was called a desire or something, with a plastic back that bubbled out within a month from the battery getting warm. Eventually, in Kate 2016, I switched to iPhone SE (first gen) once I had enough saved from a real job. Loved the thing. Upgraded to xr eventually which was a lackluster experience due to stuff like the screen burning in spots and other annoyances. Then, I had an iPhone 11, great phone, no complaints, switched to a 12 mini for the size, color, and 5g. Within 6 months, total battery capacity dropped to 85% max capacity and they refused to replace it under warranty. I didn't do anything different with that phone that I've done with any phone previous and any phone since, only one with that issue. Eventually, I had a trade in offer to fully cover the z flip 4 and I took it. I loved everything about the phone and it was a breath of fresh air from the iphones. Super durable phone, better battery than any of the iphones and a better camera than any of the iphones I had, too. After some issues with my carrier, I got out of the contract and wanted to ditch the t mobile bloatware. Figured I'd get the s23 ultra for about the same value as the z flip and get a massively better battery and camera than the flip. Love this phone and its the first phone I can picture myself keeping for years in a long time. So, not a pixel user, but I've got a pretty good variety under my belt and this has been my favorite by far.;0
4856;14okawc;pampidu;1688331835.0;Scroll is completely different. Stock Android has very lazy scroll (like scrolling in the mud) which doesn't accelerate much.

Everything runs fast and smooth, it might stay a degree or two cooler than the pixel, but mine never had a heat problem. I enjoy one UI a lot so I don't even miss material U. There are so many plus signs for this phone. I used 5g once when I traveled 2.5 hours away and it was blazing fast. Battery lasts all day even though it's searching for a signal a lot. I get about 2 more hours out of the S23U than I did with the P6P. I think I'll mention screen brightness here, the Samsung annihilates the pixel in that. Both great phones, but to me for future, I choose the S23U as my daily driver. One thing I can get used to is the jump from 128 to 512gb storage. 8k video and raw pictures eat up a lot of space.;0

4861;14okawc;onekamaraj;1688312560.0;"P7P vs S23U

In terms of sheer potential, the S23U blows the P7P out the water. But the P7P makes up for what it lacks in brawn (hardware) with brains (software).

However, the folks from Google put a well-refined experience in your hands right out the box with great point and shoot camera experience, fluid snappy animations and little pixel exclusive features than go a long to improving your quality of life. The Achilles heel of the P7P is battery life. It struggles to hold a candlelight to the S23U's 1day+ of battery life under similar conditions.

The S23U however packs a better camera array, better SoC, better build quality, comparable speaker array, greater display, snappier fingerprint sensor, secure face unlock and the cherry on top that is the S-pen. The S23U is able to be a snappier device thanks to Samsung's exclusive colab with Qualcomm in the SoC department this year. You get also Dolby audio which is something that Google doesn't give you with the Pixels. The cameras pack a punch with better OIS on the main and the ability to make clearer lit photos out of what seems to be pitch darkness. Photos from the S23U still come out over saturated and with exaggerated colors and sharpness most times. While the S23U's photos are crisper, the P7P produces photos that are just as great but look truer to life.

In addition to getting more times out of a fully charge battery on the S23U, it charges faster too often getting a full charge in about 1 hour.

Given the tinkerer that I am, If I had to pick one device, I'd pick the S23U because with sufficient customization, it gets even with and way better than the P7P. If what you want is a cheaper flagship device that shoots more accurate photos with smoother UX out of the box and don't mind having to recharge two or more times a day, the P7P would be your pick.";0

4889;14okawc;yungfishstick;1688390609.0;"The camera is definitely still very good. I'd say it's a step below Google when it comes to JPGs. As for manual controls it's far superior to Pixel but Samsung's RAWs aren't as good as Google's RAWs. Pixel by default does stacked RAW and so does Galaxy in the Expert RAW app but while Pixel's 12MP RAWs look fairly natural without any noticeable processing, Galaxy's 12MP stacked RAWs look pretty artificial from all 4 cameras as it's baking sharpening into the image. Turning sharpening down in an editing software like Lightroom helps a little but you can't get rid of the sharpening baked into the image. Dynamic range tends to be very good but the processing just ruins everything else. Nighttime is the only time you should be using 12MP mode in Expert RAW as in difficult lighting the whole processing pipeline and frame stacking helps more than it hurts. Their 50MP stacked RAWs, however, are amazing and are honestly the only reason to ever use the app. Some phones in high-res mode will have worse dynamic range but in this case dynamic range is the same as 12MP mode and the images are much more detailed with more room for cropping along with a much more forgiving noise pattern in some conditions. Zooming in all the way will still reveal a more artificial look to the details but compared to 12MP mode it's still a drastic improvement. 12MP tends to look more artificially sharp than 50MP downscaled to 12MP.

Regular pro mode (single-frame RAW) is just okay. 12MP RAWs in good lighting look perfectly natural without all the processing issues of Expert RAW but they tend to have some noise no matter what. In difficult lighting conditions the quality nosedives so you're better off using Expert RAW. 50MP RAWs are not very good and aren't detailed. They almost seem upscaled from a lower resolution. Dynamic range for both modes is worse than Expert RAW only because there's no frame stacking but it isn't the worst thing ever. 

Night mode is easily on par with Google's except with much better details, though there's no night mode RAW support like there is with Pixel if that matters to you. Color accuracy/white balance isn't as good as Google's but it isn't too far off. Even though Expert RAW stacks frames it doesn't compensate for hand movement while stacking so you'll end up with motion blur at longer exposures. 

As for the rest of the phone, I use it exactly like I used my 6 Pro so I haven't really used many of the features it comes with and just use the bare necessities. I can see the appeal of the S-Pen but I only take it out to use smart select for screenshots so it's nice knowing it's there but it's kind of useless to me. The S23 Ultra is a great phone but unless you're a power user or don't mind opening your wallet for one of the most well rounded phones on the market I'd personally stick with your 4a if there isn't anything wrong with it or wait for the 8 Pro/8. Unfortunately Tensor is essentially Exynos with a different name and carries all of Exynos' problems, most notably poor efficiency, relatively lower performance and worse battery life. Tensor G2 is no better than original Tensor since it's basically just the original Tensor with a slight overclock and better modem so hopefully G3 is a substantial improvement.";0

4910;14okawc;import-mimikatz;1688312344.0;"Overall, I do like the s23u more than the Pixel 6 pro. I think it's a better overall package. 

I can live with the lack of Pixel exclusive features and my pet is a 9 year old rabbit with arthritis so he doesn't move around very fast but if you plan to upgrade to a Samsung phone and one of your primary use cases is to take pictures of your kids, pets, or other moving subjects then I'd maybe stick with the Pixel line up or maybe look at the iPhone. 

When it does come to the camera, the front camera is better on the s23. The video is a lot better, and sill photos of stationary subjects are on par with Pixel. 

The battery life on the s23 ultra is fantastic, the screen is great, and I enjoy some of the other samsung only features they have in android.

Also, pixel 7 series seems to have a very bas camera lens. It just seems to break very easily even in your pocket, if you ever choose to buy one, I strongly reccomend a lens protector.
Coming from a Samsung Ambassador, and a samsung authorised tech, the A series is built for everyday users with better batteries than the S series, ok processor, ok cameras ( even if every phone nowadays seems to have ""great"" cameras ) but they are not built to be use more than your 2-3 years contract. I mean, you CAN still use it, but as you experienced, it just get slower and battery last shorter.
I personnaly would reccomend S serie if you are the kind of person noticing the processor rapidity. I sell a lot of used S21 to my customer and they are very happy, for a low price point. Only issue is the battery, but honestly once you get used to using fast charging, its very not that big if a deal, since a quick 15 min of charge gives me 40-50% wick is way more that i need ( coming from a ZFlip user, they are known for having bad battery)

Hello all, venting here since not sure where else or if anyone else can relate.

I bought a 1TB EVO PLUS NVMe in late Dec 2021 off amazon, waited a few months to install it.. had it running my main OS for about 8 months. The following December, my computer randomly wouldn't boot. Re-formatted on a seperate SSD, when i got back into the OS and took a look at the device, it had tons of bad blocks (including the ones that had the OS on it) i was able to take off some of the data, but alot of it was corrupt... whats worse, is since all the boot and permissions are corrupt, i can't format or wipe the drive.. ive tried everythig, its completely locked, so essentially bricked. Samsung not only has a 5 year warranty.. but its even plastered on the box in pretty large writing 5 YEAR WARRANTY.

**Support Chat 1:** Asks me a bunch of questoins likely off his standard call handling.. no worries.. i explain to him above.. takes forever to validate the item asking me tons of questions.. then finally says.. okay well we can RMA it, but first you need to go to an official Samsung repair place.. I ask... its a flash memory device with bad blocks... what are they going to do ""its part of the process, they will either fix it like new or diagnose its defective"". They give me 2 options (not official samsung stores just stores that are licensed to repair Samsung product).. both 30 minute drives from me. I ask chat.. is there a reference ticket or anything?! like I just show up and ask them to look at it for free?! don't they need to know this is through support ""no its fine just go in"".

I drive down to the store, tell the whats up.. the person at the store literally tells me ""its a NVMe drive.. what do you want me to do with it?... we only fix phones or hardware"".

**Support Chat 2:** Explain everything to the new chat rep, including my pointless drive out to the repair shop... re-validates everything.. then tells me ""you need to go through amazon"". Im like.. dude.. i bought this over a year ago.. why would amazon RMA it?! ""anyone who sells our product have an arrangement with us that they replace the item""... so while hes typing this nonsense to me.. i go to Amazon support.. and i go to my order for 2021, try to request a return on the item.. it doesn't just say ""sorry contact your vendor"" generically .. but specifically the link to the chat i was currently on.. and the official Samsung support 1800 number. I tell the guy.. yo.. im already on the site, it says its you guys ""nono you cant use chat or their return process.. you need to call"" im like.. i really doubt some random person a ttheir helpdesk will know about some special Samsung arrangement.. ""trust me call... I will get someone to reach out to you on my end to get things rolling if they can't replace it, but they will.""... get off the chat... get an email from them like 20 minutes later basically saying ""yea go contact amazon, k, thanks"".

Contact Amazon... and to no surprise, they say.. this is ordered way too long ago for us to cover it.. contact your manufacturer for the warranty.

**Support Chat 3:** Explain everything above.. tell him how im getting pretty frustrated... puts me through all the troubleshooting and validation steps again.. tries to get rid of me again.. i put up a fight, and he says okay no problem il get the RMA going.. heres your ticket number, and someone will reach out to you soon to get information regarding shipping ect.

Finally think ive gotten somewhere.. wait 2 weeks... nothing.. go into chat to just find out the status since i haven't been reached out to...

**Support Chat 4:** Give a breif background and the ticket number... she tells me that that ticket number doesnt exist or match a format of any system they have there (guy lied about making a ticket to get rid of me). So at this point i kinda lose my shit... explain to her everything that has already happened, she apologizes and says I am going to get ""customer relations"" to reach out to you regarding your poor ex\[perience and make this right. I explain... what exactly is the ETA on ""customer relations"" because it sure feels like for the 4th time, im being told to go away and wait or do something else.. she says 2 days maximum but her guess is within a few hours.

2 more weeks go by... im done with this shit.. so I call to speak with someone. I get on the phone with a phone rep.. explain everything up until now.. explain not only should this premium level SSD not be dying in 8 months, but the way ive been treated is actually insane. She starts revalidating and troubleshooting everything again.. she doesnt even seem to understand what an NVME or my problem is, she thinks im talking about an external harddrive ect. I was trying to not get mad at her because its not her fault.. but like... i just explain all the crap i went through and then i spend 25 minutes going through it again.... so after over a halfhour.. she tells me ""im going to send you to business to business.. thats our escalations department and should be able to help you further and hopefully get it replaced.. Im like thanks! She asks me to sit on hold... i wait 10 minutes.. takes me off hold.. says shes transfering me..wait 10 more minutes, same woman tells me okay here we go (i assume shes handing off the case)... i get transfered to another employee... ""Hello Samsung business to business how can i help you"" im like.. did the previous associate not breif you?! ""what? no my phone just rang and i picked up"" im like YOUR ACTUALLY kidding me right now... she cold transfered me?! ""i guess... whats your ticket number"" im like i dont have one.. becaus ei just spent 45 minutes talking to someone who ""escalated"" to you.. which apperently just means cold transfering my call ""okay whats your issue"" my NVME is broken i need it RMA'd ""oh.. i can't help you.. let me transfer you to tech support sec"" im like NONONO ... I'm done with this.. transfer me to your manager.. im so fed up. ""I don't have a manager"" im like then transfer me to the Tech support supervisor .. not random tech support.. the manager ""okay sure"" ... she puts me through to the generic support queue.. get a new agent.. we start from scratch again... I tell them im not going through this a 6th time.. give me a manager.. she keeps making excuses trying to stall me.. says her manager is in a meeting...

Tells me she can't escalate to the manager if she doesn't know my problem.. so I give her the overview, but i tell her, this goes so far beyond getting this replaced.. this is the most insane support ive ever had, all you guys do is try to get rid of people and pass the buck ASAP.. i need to speak to a manager or supervisor, im not doing this again.... tells me all the managers are in a meeting, but validates my phone numebr and email.. and says i will get a call ASAP.

2 weeks later, still nothing... what do I even do at this point?! Its crazy to me this is how a company like Samsung conducts their support. Seemingly its impossible to get through to anyone outside of level 1, and whenever i try they just get rid of me. Anyone with a similar experience (hopefully not this painful) that figured out how to get it resolved?";0

Good lock has basically almost everything I need for customization.

* Theme Park: custom keyboard theme, custom quick panel theme, apply OneYou icon pack to match my wallpaper, custom volume panel color. I do these since Samsung's material you sucks and I prefer to have specific colors.

* Quick star: allow more icons in the quick panel when expanded, change position of clock and show seconds in the quick panel
* Niceshot: to add a delete button
* Routines +: add touch macros to my routines
* MultiStar: add multi focus and remove blur effect when adjusting split view
* Camera Assistant: better control of some settings for the camera
* Sound assistant: better volume panel, especially when expanded
* RegiStar: double tap the back of my phone to take a screenshot and to change the layout of my settings so the most frequent ones I use are at the top
* Keys Cafe: customize keyboard layout even more

Home Up - You can make your app drawer or home screen display more apps, make smaller folders so it's easier to reach, edit task changer so it's also easier to reach

One Hand Operation - has tons of features. You can make it so that one swipe from the edge of your screen you can turn on flashlight, take a screenshot, etc I like to include Quick Tools in this so I can easily access some stuff from the notification panel without having to swipe from the top of the phone. Tho I think you'd have to have gestures turned on with this instead of the navigation buttons.

Multi Star - also pretty great for easier multi-tasking

Edge Panel - This one isn't in Good Lock but you can enable just in the settings. You can do so much with this. Just a quick swipe from the edge of the screen and you can access a calculator, clipboard, smart select, or apps.

Hope that helps a bit!";0

5092;14nwg9q;Driftan;1688240317.0;"There's quite a bit of fearmongering in these comments. Your phone should be fine. If your phone was constantly vibrating because you had a button pressed down, and it was in an enclosed space, there's nothing out of the ordinary about it getting hot. There's an old galaxy note 5 (2015) I own that has a software bug that causes it to constantly vibrate until the phone is restarted (which happens every month or so), and it gets pretty hot if I don't immediately catch it, even though it's out in the open and under a running ceiling fan that's set at medium. Your phone getting extremely hot in an enclosed space because it's constantly vibrating for an extended period of time is expected.

As for the battery percentage jumping down from 85% to 84% rather quickly—as someone else has mentioned in the thread—this is normal. This happens on my S23+ as well. It most likely stops charging immediately after reaching 85%, so it's unable to reach the higher end of an 85% charge (closest to 86% charge).

For the transfer process being interrupted, since it was between an Apple and Samsung device, I'm going to assume this transfer process was done via wireless? My transfer process went smoothly, but I was moving data via a wired connection between two Samsung devices (Galaxy Note 8 [2017] to Galaxy S23+), so maybe your issue might have stemmed from transferring data between an Apple and Samsung device, or maybe you were transferring wireless and that caused your issue if the connection wasn't stable.

5127;14nwg9q;Fiorix1725;1688230124.0;85% to 68% with 6 hours idle and 1hr 20 min SOT is pretty normal. 17% in an hour 20, will bring you to 6+ hour SOT with an 85% charge. I wouldn't be worried. AOD drains maybe 5 -7% especially with that much idle time. And if it's fairly new your battery will get better over time.;0

if that would be old grumpy man in his 60s who is close to his retirement, he will probably do nothing. If you will find young man who is very helpful, he might do something. you can always provide anything (like if it was on marketplace, and you have chats, or any other selling website) they can always at least try to find via IP, if someone was not really careful (e.g. selling from his own home), they can find him. Also, was that trade made online (via post) or did you met him in person? maybe there was a camera somewhere, who caught you two.

also, it may not be his first steal. they might have other cases similar to this - once my brother's gf (now wife) bought dress online. paid and never received. went to the police, and after few months they called her they found other 20 girls with the same problem, and that they found a man who did this.

The flat screen is also way more comfortable and able to be used with tempered screen protectors. It is the best phone you will find. You are not going to find a microsd on a good phone anymore.

5268;14o6dy6;Junior_Ad4596;1688457631.0;The s23 is a very high performance phone. There is no need to wait for s24 without knowing it will be as amazing as this series. The 8 gen 2 chipset is the first chipset in a samsung in years that has amazing performance and battery life because of tsmc litography and more efficient architecture. It is on par if not better compared to the iphone 14 series. I am sorry but with the horrible exynos on the s20+ i think there is a very big reason to go for s23 series. You say you would give up lots of things to get s23? What kind of things? Sd card reader and a charging dock? In my opinion thats not that big a deal.;0
5269;14o6dy6;JBond-007_;1688507840.0;"In my opinion, the ""few extras"" that are offered with the S23 Ultra are not that big of a deal over my S20+ which has Snapdragon 865. And when compared to the S23+,  there are even less incentives to upgrade!

As you say, my S20+ has expandable SD storage up to 1TB... In addition, my S20+ has 12 GB of RAM rather than the 8 GB that Samsung now says is all we need... sounds like a downgrade or yet another Samsung profit making measure...

My S20+ has way better resolution than the S23+;  3200x1440 vs 2340x1080... 524 vs 390 DPI.

And my S20+ is the perfect sized phone which happens to be about the same length as the S23 Ultra. - Incidentally, I'm one of a small minority who can somewhat comfortably carry around the S23 Ultra... but for most people, it is too big and too heavy.

So, for someone in my shoes, I'd coincidentally give the exact same advice that people were giving on this forum 8 months ago...  

Wait and see what the S24 offers when it comes out in 8 months and then make a decision. If the S23 is the best phone at that point in time, you will get a huge bargain on it! And if the s24 is a better phone, which it just might be,  then take advantage of the early buy/pre-sale specials.

If someone absolutely needs to buy a phone right now, they could either go for the S23 or another phone at 1/4 the cost of the S23.  IMO there really is no hurry to jump into an expensive S23 & accessories at this time .. not enough benefits from Samsung vs what they have taken away from us customers. 😕";0

I'm upgrading to the S23U because the good deal here in USA on it. Otherwise, would have stayed with S22U. Great phone, but yes, battery life is not the best, but good. Just get a portable  battery pack for it. 

Not sure what an S23U costs (on sale, upcoming sales?) , but it would make a great 5 year investment. I don't suggest payments on one, but in this case: a 5 year phone with a couple of years of payments.

Motorola?

I use my phone all day and it usually has battery through the night. I just really don't like that time it takes to charge. I've heard that the S23 series has a better battery charging situation, but in the states the prices between the S22U and S23U aren't very far apart at the moment, so if that's the all around case, go for the newer.

5375;14nf3hy;ggjunior7799;1688224502.0;"The easiest way to know if the s21 ultra is genuine is by dialling * # 0 * # in the dialer. It will show up the diagnostic screen. If it doesn't show, it's not genuine. Then, you can test each function of the phone from that diagnostic. 

Another thing to take note of is that you have to test out the camera. Some old S21 ultra have very bad autofocus (hardware problem), and you even need to press into the camera itself for it to focus (i had encounter one person tried selling me their s21 ultra with this major issue touting it as in perfect condition and another listing that honestly said that the autofocus is broken). To test this issue, try focusing on something using the camera about a meter away. It shouldn't take more than half a second to focus.

If you're not comfortable meeting people, and would rather just buy used phone online (highly not recommended as many seller could lie in their description), try asking them to record a video for you using the s21 ultra, while they filming the s21 ultra itself with their own phone.

I highly doubt this autofocus issue is common, though. It's just for peace of mind.";0

I don't feel apps on android are worse than iOS ( at least at this point in time), on the other hand some apps like whatsapp, telegram are just better looking on android and I find them easier to use. Yes, photos taken by in-app cameras are definitely better on iOS.

The thing is iOS is differently designed and so the apps are suited according to it while android is just more fluid when moving around. When one moves from iOS to android, they are used to how iOS functions (like there is a particular select button, done button, back button in iOS but in android it is usually long press, swiping back etc.) and so they find android app clunky. And iOS users in when moving, are more likely to complain compared to android users who have always been fed that iOS is the superior OS and so they just shut up adapt to iOS ways & means.

While some apps may be better on one OS and some on the other, there is no objective way to say apps are always better on OS over the other.";0

5466;14mz49t;Bryanmsi89;1688142079.0;"3 reasons (and this is not true for EVERY app, some are better on Android).

1. **iPhone consistency:** Apple has a much narrower range of devices to design for making it easier for developers to build apps without worrying as much about CPU, Memory, Screen size, etc. 
2. **iPhone popularity**: in the USA, most people have iPhone (including the developers themselves) so they build the apps for the audience
3. **Android fragmentation:** iOS updates work with most phones, so the OS fragmentation is far far lower on iPhones than Android.  Android app developers have to contect with a huge range of potential OS versions and sub-versions along with manufacturer UI skins 

According to StatCounter, in North America slightly more than 1/3 of Android phones are running Android 13 which is nearly a year old, and the most popular version is Android 10 which came out in Sept 2019 (almost 4 years ago). Meanwhile, more than 85% of iPhone owners are using iOS 16 (the current version).";0
5467;14mz49t;Interesting-Sir-9776;1688135269.0;Simple, apple pays app developers to only optimize for apple products. Samsung is the most popular brand worldwide so makes no sense that apps like Snapchat aren't optimized for Samsung. It's not THAT difficult they're just either too lazy or purposefully not doing it;0

Its very hard for small developers to test for that.    Apple had a better set up for app developers, so can make better apps.";0

One point for Android is that in third party apps the system-wide text scaling always works. Move the slider in Android's screen settings and the font size will change everywhere to your liking. Not so on iOS! Move the same slider there and while in Apple apps the font size will change as expected, in third party ones it will not in some 2/3rds of apps. Or, it will change only on some screens but not others within the same app. Of the apps I mentioned above only Gmail has it implemented everywhere. I don't know why the same developers can do it in the Android version but not in the iOS version. (I find tiny text very tiring to read so this is an important /but personal preference/ thing for me).

Another story are my local Polish apps. Of the local apps (banking, public transit, healthcare etc.) some are the same quality on both, but some are markedly worse on iOS. The opposite does not happen. I think this can be explained by the very low iPhone ownership here.

Finally, there is one type of app where iOS apps are way better. The Keepass clients. I tried KeePassium and Strongbox on iOS; and Keepass2Android and Keepass DX on Android. The Android ones are quite clunky. Also the autofill implementation on Android seems much more a hit and miss, so maybe the poor user experience is not only down to the apps. Anyways, the iOS clients are paid and quite expensive while the Android ones are free (with voluntary donations). I think the difference here is that for the iOS Keepass client developers writing the app is an income-generating job while for the Android developers it is a hobby and they can only devote so much time and effort to it, can't hire a graphical designer, etc. Maybe we need a paid Android Keepass client?";0

I imagine it’s hard because Android has so many different variations, but behavior is often strange (e.g. in OneUI if you turn off the on-screen nav bar and use swipe controls, most apps cut off oddly at the bottom and have no padding). Also most apps don’t scale quote right for different display sizes. I currently have an S23 Ultra and many apps look a bit cartoonish scaled up to its larger display.

As far as app stores, lots of reports over the years about how the iOS App Store generates a ton more sales than Android (this includes in-app purchases and subscriptions, of course). Here’s one article, but feel free to Google and find others. https://www.phonearena.com/news/app-store-users-spend-more-than-double-google-play-users-subscriptions_id138692

It’s pros and cons. I like Samsung hardware more (truly legendary displays), but the downside for app development is the lack of parity in design language across the entire ecosystem. Apple has a lot more parity, but the downside is the look and feel of iOS is difficult to personalize (you’re really just locked into the Apple aesthetic). Again, I enjoy switching back and forth, there are just some current realities with things like app development and some limitations of Android (even with great launchers like One UI and Pixel’s launcher).";0

Imagine if these issues were present on iphones. This issue would get resolved overnight.;0
5597;14mz49t;reindeerfalcon;1688202219.0;Sentences like these are why I know you don't know what you're babbling about. You're right but it's only paints a small part of the picture;0
5598;14mz49t;JoinetBasteed;1688309895.0;Sorry to break it to you but AI isn't even remotely close to replacing developers;1
5599;14mz49t;JoinetBasteed;1688314796.0;Again you seem to think the developers are the ones deciding what to do, have you ever had a job in your life? It's the higher ups that makes decisions, and they often base those decisions on the ROI, and optimizing for specific phones is almost never a good ROI;0
5600;14mz49t;anonyy;1688283646.0;That's upto Developers they don't want to spend anymore time and money checking and amending their code than is necessary;0
5601;14mz49t;Interesting-Sir-9776;1688310640.0;They don't all use one ui? They don't all use snapdragon in the US? And exynos abroad? No way there isn't a more simple solution for one brand each;0
5602;14mz49t;Clever_Angel_PL;1688152554.0;maybe start using AI instead of your brain, as it seems to be struggling so definitely AI will make it easier to be open-minded;0
5603;14mz49t;jleep2017;1688149017.0;It's not really reset it's more cost efficient to not do it. If they do their jobs become 10 to 50 times bigger than what it would normally be because they have to do that job for every phone. That's like a tailer making jeans for every person individually. Instead of the average shape. He then has to measure every person and do it exactly tailored to him. Instead of doing a general size. He also can't release the jeans until he does everyone's pants either. It doesn't make sense.;0
5604;14mz49t;ibrodirkakuracpalac;1688157930.0;Lol you are the first one who will be replaced by AI. Anyone thinking that any task can't be THAT hard must certainly have the brain capacity of AI.;0

5665;14n3ffj;Safe_Opinion_2167;1688155997.0;"Generally, when you want a Fold, you have special needs related to the big interior screen (productivity, gaming, etc...). It is not meant to *look good*, but have a practical value that no usual smartphone category provides. But it comes with compromises such as being more fragile, not dust resistant, heavier and much thicker, the weird form factor, the crease in the middle of the foldable screen, the hinge that may not work as well after one or two years, somewhat sketchy app compatibility, older generation cameras, mediocre selfie camera...

Speak with your colleagues and see it it's all roses for them, I don't think it will be.

Like everything, there is no perfect product, but products tuned to certain uses but also worse at others.

I mean, Samsung has had time to refine its formula, and it is probably the most reliable foldable on the market, but we can see other manufacturers trying slightly different aspect ratios and managing to remove the gap when folded, so there is still definitely improvement to be made.";0

5698;14n24ny;Easy_Lengthiness7179;1688144061.0;"Yes, having your screen always on will use more battery than if your screen is turned off when you are not using it.

How much of your battery charge it uses depends on a few factors. If you thinks it's worth it then do it. You will find out exactly what it's like after literally just a day of having it on and a day of not having it on.";0
5699;14n24ny;BingeV;1688174871.0;About 5% a day, according to my phone at least. It depends on your AOD set up though. If you have it very minimalistic then it'll drain less than mine.;0

5703;14n24ny;chanchan05;1688168150.0;Around 0.5-1.5% per hour, depending on several factors like size and type of clock or if you use an image on the AOD, if it's autobrightness or not, etc.;0

5716;14mumun;iAnomie;1688116645.0;"I came to s23 ultra from iPhone. 

Honestly I was really surprised by the battery. It's great on par with the pro maxes, which is a first foe android.

As for cameras, zoom is unbelievable, there is no competition. However, I have to say not a fan of photo processing, photos look a bit fake even with HDR turned off. But iphone is no better at that part especially with 14 series.

All in all, i like the phone. Will I be keeping it a lot longer? Unfortunately no bcoz it's HUGE. Literally the biggest phone. It get uncomfortable to use for me. 

I hope Samsung realises a similar specced 6.1 inch like apple does with the Pro model.";0
5717;14mumun;suslu22;1688115738.0;i have to say it's great, i preordered it and it came with the galaxy watch5 pro which works great with the phone. the camera is absolutely amazing, i took some fine shots with it, also moon shots look amazing. the battery life is kind of amazing too, for me a full charge lasts about 35 hours. (note: i have the 512gb storage 12gb ram model);0
5718;14mumun;PAcMAcDO99;1688125024.0;Coming from s10 lite. All I can say is it is amazing. Only had it for abour 5 days tho.;0
5719;14mumun;insanemaelstrom;1688134669.0;"Starting with performance, it performs extremely well, haven't had lag or any slow downs. Have tried some games and they all run pretty smoothly. 
Coming on to battery life, I have the battery protect thing on( so it only charges to 85%) and I start recharging when battery level reaches 20%. Still get around 5 to 7 hrs of sot( depending on if I am outside and using mobile data instead of wifi). Also, this is with Bluetooth being on always and display set to max resolution. 
I don't use the camera a lot, but I usually get better pictures compared to my brother's iphone 13 pro max. 
Finally the software. I have only had one big( sometimes while scrolling ( say reddit for example) the copy, cut, select, option bar pops up and doesn't go away until I select any of the options). Besides that haven't noticed any bugs or software issues.";0
5720;14mumun;Krystalgoddess_;1688135520.0;"It holding up great, I don't be stressed about charging my phone every night. I often just charge here and there but never fully charged most days. And there is an option to have adaptive power saving.

Cameras are great, especially the zoom. You need to experiment with the different cameras modes, I uses the food camera mode and night mode alot. I find the pro mode best for when something overexposed/too bright, you can tone it down.  

Software is good, one of my favorite features are the edge panels, can access your favorite contacts,apps, write quick notes, quick calculator, and more easily. And should check out the galaxy store, there are apps that will enhance your experience.";0
5721;14mumun;LiterallyZeroSkill;1688181489.0;"I just got it last week. Came from a Pixel 7 Pro.

So far so good. Battery life is definitely better than the 7 Pro. Reception is fine.

Camera is good, though if I'm being completely honest, I do like the camera and the UI on the Pixel more. 

But there's nothing really to complain about here. Solid all-round phone with no notable weaknesses. I will be moving to the Pixel 8 Pro later this year though.";0

5724;14mumun;jquest71;1688124994.0;I've had Android phones since the beginning of Android. Galaxy S3, S4, Motorola, Google Nexus and Pixels, LG, and more recently Samsung Note 9, S21 Ultra, S22, and now S23 Ultra. So believe me when I say that the S23 Ultra is the best Android phone I've ever owned, and I believe the best on the market currently. Believe the hype, believe the reviews.

All in all it seems to be the best Android out there.

&#x200B;

The iPhone 15 is \~3 months away and maybe it gets a zoom camera. Which would be the only big difference in my eyes from the 12PM.

Waht are you missung with the iPhone right now?

&#x200B;

I won't get the iPhone 15 myself, simply because the 12PM still feels like a new Phone and besides maybe a zoom camera, there are not many new features anyway. And the Battery still lasts for two days.";0

 Sorry samsung nerds but the ultra feels like a good spending of money vs like the s6lite (got it on major discount and was still trash). The battery life is solid vs my old 13Pro (which was perfect). Id say im a power user but i dont play video games on my phones or anything. Battery last a full day but around 18% left.

Camera failed within a year, inner screen died on me after a year. It's fun and compact. If you want a good camera, the zflip might not be the one for you unless you are just a point and shoot kinda person. Battery life, it's very average. You might have to charge it midway to your day. If you are very active in messaging, you have to keep opening and closing your phone which might wear out the initial screen protractor faster.

5915;14mcxmt;siliconevalley69;1688071567.0;"Fwiw 

Galaxy Buds live are the best fit. It's a bummer they haven't been updated.

Galaxy Buds Pro are quite literally not made for human ears. There's pages of articles out there about the issues they caused people. Samsung should have recalled them 

Galaxy Buds Pro 2 are super comfortable and a great traditional bud.

My guess is that you have the OG Buds Pro";0
5916;14mcxmt;exclaimprofitable;1688066766.0;"I feel that the buds pro 2 is missing a size between medium and large. With medium size the earbuds don't block out any sound, so noise reduction doesn't work, with large size the earphones slowly work their way out of my ears, so I have to wear a hat or something to keep them in.

For workouts I use the Buds Live, really innovative shape, that just stays in the ear, so they don't come out at all, and they let some ambient sound through.";0
5917;14mcxmt;champ19nz;1688067284.0;They're  so bad that I had no choice but to cave in and buy those comply foam tips. They were a game changer for fitting, ambient sound, and noise cancelling, but it's annoying that samsung tips are so bad.;0

5919;14mcxmt;Sylectsus;1688070948.0;Yeah, I have the 2nd gen pros and they are annoying AF. the fit is garbage. It's annoying to even think about accidentally brushing against them cause they will cause them to pause. But other times when you are TRYING to pause, nothing happens.;1
5920;14mcxmt;Hyndman89;1688070857.0;"I'm on the Buds Live, came with my S21U and I can't fault them. 

You can get third party memory foam type tips to go on the other buds that give a more secure fit";0
5921;14mcxmt;alorne85;1688065111.0;Agreed. I only use them when commuting and even then I find the need to adjust them frequently.;0

Foam tips are the game changer.";0
5923;14mcxmt;DLPSR1;1688070666.0;My pro2 fit ok, but my disappointment was ambient sounds as hearing aids backup when their batteries are wearing down. I hear better with them out of my ears I think. Maybe a future firmware update will help.;0
5924;14mcxmt;tellurdogisayhello;1688073758.0;"I just recently picked up the buds pro 2, and you're right. They're ungodly uncomfortable when they do fit, which is rare....what really drives me nuts is having to adjust them constantly, but then they pick up my touch and activate the touch pause/play control.

They sound good, but that's their only redeeming quality. Pretty bummed I didn't return them within my return period...";0

5927;14mcxmt;AFS23;1688075850.0;The Buds Live work the best for me. I tried the Buds2 Pro and they did not stay in, so I ended up returning them.;0
5928;14mcxmt;Nicolas30129;1688076493.0;Buds 2 often need to be readjusted for me indeed. I only use them while shopping/city cycling so I cannot imagine using them during sport.;0

5931;14mcxmt;Gold-Temperature-841;1688079929.0;I only use AirPods Gen 3 because they are the most comfortable headphones I ever had. Anything with rubber tips suck. I won’t touch the AirPods Pro because they got rubber tips.;0

Buds Pro 2 fit my ears fine. Before that I had air pods pro 2	and I hand to constantly re adjust them even when I wasn't doing anything active at all.";0

5938;14mcxmt;chanchan05;1688084663.0;Just your ears. Everybody's ears have differences in shape. Yours just happens to be one where the silicon tips don't fit well. Just get aftermarket tips with more sizes.;0
5939;14mcxmt;TeddyRuger;1688086840.0;Happy with the cheap Sony ones and the generic $10 sport earbuds I got. It's not worth the $$$ for something so easily lost or stolen.;0

5944;14mcxmt;richardizard;1688095792.0;It took a while for me to find which insert fits best. I actually went with a different size per ear lol. Once I got it to fit snug, it felt good and bass response was great. They're definitely not the best earbuds out there but they're a great first wireless earbud for me.;0
5945;14mcxmt;flogsmen;1688101228.0;There's a lot of options. Buy them all send back the ones that don't fit. I've stuck with my buds+ because I use them for ear plugs at work as well. All the new ones are vented and don't seal out the noise. Buds+ are air tight and create a vacuume it feels like and the wing tips hold them in place.;0

5961;14mcxmt;TealCatto;1688147746.0;Honestly I don't know why fully wireless buds became ubiquitous. They are just worse than wired (to each other, not to the phone) earbuds. The wired ones have the battery in little packs further down the wire so the in-ear part isn't heavy, but if it does fall out, it doesn't fall to the ground because the wire is around your neck. And if you want to take it out of your ear, you don't need to look for a place to put it. Just let it drop. Also battery life is like 3x as long. I use Sony WI-C310. Comfy, don't fall out, not an issue if they do fall out sometimes, and only $18 (Amazon US). I feel like I'm trying to advertise them but I swear I'm not. I just went through a few different ones until I found the perfect solution. It might not be perfect for everyone, but I also know for sure that truly wireless bean or cigarette like earbuds can't be suitable for everyone either.;0
5962;14mcxmt;saga_rai;1688163572.0;I had the Buds 2 and sold them because they wouldn't stay in my ears. Even the slightest of head movement and they would fall out.;0

5965;14mcxmt;Immediate-Pea-8297;1688428663.0;Make sure the earbuds are in your ears firmly do the fit test to make sure you have a good seal cuz the earbuds have sensors on them to know when they're in your ears and if they're not in your ears good enough then you won't be able to start your music pause any of that like if you're playing music and then you pull the earbuds out it will pause for you to make sure they're in your ears better always do the fit test;0

I just put them in to check and it's not terrible, but if I could just tick the ambient mic volume of the buds 2pro up just a tick or two in ambient. It would almost equal my hearing aids flexibility and adjustment.

At what seems like the best settings, it's too low. 360 is on, voice detect, amplified ambient is centered. I'd have turn the TV volume up and people's voices. I do have hearing protect volume on and maxed out. Of course they're not  $6,000 hearing aids either.😂😉 For $104 for they're not awful.";0

I have the Buds2 Pro and unless I use the supplied tips then foam or silicone tips supposedly made for them come off and remain in my ears and I have to use tweezers to get them out.

I haven't managed to get a good seal with the large or medium size tips and they let in too much ambient noise.

I've gone back to using Sennheiser Momentum ear buds as I can get a perfect seal with them. Unfortunately the Sennheiser tips are slightly too large to stay connected to the Buds Pro and they also remain in my ear.";0

6016;14m9cnt;Spicy_Mustard007;1688056412.0;I like them. I had an S21 Ultra, which had more rounded corners, and I didn't like it. The square corners are reminiscent of the Note design, which I loved. It feels more premium to me. Just my opinion, though.;0
6017;14m9cnt;giaphox;1688056364.0;"Imo it makes the phone looks stronger and more luxurious and less like a toy than for example the A series. 

Plus the corners are quite rounded too so it doesn't hurt at all. Or you just learn to hold the phone with your pinky finger, instead of your palm.";0
6018;14m9cnt;jquest71;1688056234.0;Square corners on my S23U don't bother me, guess I've adapted to it. That and I don't hold my phone in my hand for hours at a time so it never really becomes a problem. I did prefer the form factor of my S22, and I generally prefer a more compact phone but my big thumbs don't type as well on them. And I like using the S pen, so I guess the Ultra is the best for me. Compared to the S21 Ultra, the 23 Ultra is way more ergonomic.;0
6019;14m9cnt;domition;1688063588.0;I definitely prefer the squared off corners. It fits content on screens better and has a stronger look. I always use a case though so it doesn't really make a difference to me in the long run.;0

6024;14m9cnt;EggplantHuman6493;1688074273.0;I hate the design of the Ultra, neutral about the S22/S23/new A series. I liked the A71 design more, with how round it was. More comfortable;0
6025;14m9cnt;RoxinFootSeller;1688077030.0;I like them, they don't seem obstructive imho, but I have zero problems with the rounded corners of the S10+, they're subtle and don't really cut things.;0

6028;14m9cnt;skyeyemx;1688061553.0;Then don't get an Ultra. Go with a Plus or a base S23.;0
6029;14m9cnt;Tsolo25;1688075403.0;💯. That is the only thing I don't like about the Ultra. They are too big and squarish. Also, I don't really use the pen so I would be great if they make s23+ with the cameras from the Ultra, that would be the perfect phone for me.;0
6030;14m9cnt;TealCatto;1688061723.0;I had a Sony XZ1 Compact phone that was square like that. It was tiny though, and even so it made a hole in my pocket after a year or so. Squatting was also painful because I would get poked. I happen to like the square look but I also like small phones so I would never use a squared Samsung because they're all too big. And I know that if I had trouble with a small squared phone, a bigger one would be worse. Aesthetically though, the history is interesting. Phones used to have rounded corners but square screens. I remember my first phone that had rounded corners and a rounded screen - LG G6. I still have it and I loved it for being so innovative and aesthetically pleasing. Since then it was considered higher end to have everything rounded, but now square gives off higher end vibes I guess, because rounded became old. Honestly, as long as the body and screen match, it's fine with me. I happen not to like extreme rounding. iPhones are almost ovals at this point, lol. My S22 base is probably the most rounding I can handle. I tried looking up the degree of corner curvature on the S22 vs iPhone and couldn't get results because everything is talking about curved screen edges.;0
6031;14m9cnt;cutegreenshyguy;1688065365.0;Note/S22U/S23U users are quite particular, and it makes sense having a stylus phone with as much space as possible, resembling a paper notebook. Yes, they are uncomfortable and dig into your hands, but most people use cases anyways.;0

6033;14m9cnt;Maxpower2727;1688068488.0;I didn't like it at first, but I've been using the S22 Ultra / S23 Ultra for quite a while now and I'm used to it.;0

Looked up a guy on xda that sells this for 25$, just for the giggles I paid him, 30 minutes later, I had completely usable and clean S23 that could be used and enrolled again.

Next month I have some meetings regarding this with samsung sales, apparently for companies they implement something like Knox Guard that is a completely separate system and it gets flagged in the bootloader, and people have really hard times getting it to bypass that (samsung uses this for their trade-in protection). So I'm curious myself. But unless you're a company, this won't apply to you

Find My Device is not the best way to find it because it can't do offline finding yet though there are reports of Google working on it https://www.nextpit.com/google-enable-find-my-device-tracking-map-offline . They should first try authorities. Carriers May be able to triangulate the phone if it connects to cell towers through the IMEI.

When you get an eSIM you tell the telecom provider that you use  this particular phone and it's IMEI is linked to your number after that you don't need a physical sim anymore and your phone becomes the identification for your number and nobody can change it because the company asks for verification which only you'd be able to provide;0

Both are more than fast enough for anything you'd want to do. Unless you're taking pictures of fast kids or pets, both camera systems are excellent.

If you're looking for pure value for money, there are a lot more options than the Samsung S series to look at.

I've used both an iPad and Galaxy Tab, and honestly ... its the same situation. Both are good. iPad has the more mature software ecosystem for art, Galaxy S Tab has better hardware in most aspects except CPU, but they're both tablets and do all the same stuff. Galaxy Tab's have a better aspect ratio for content consumption and have better speakers. Samsung DeX is pretty cool. Samsung S Tab line comes with an SD card slot with expandable storage, and a pen which is arguably a little better than Apple's, if writing is a major use case for you. If you're using it for art, you may have more luck with the iPad just due to the apps available.

Just keep in mind that if you go with Apple, you will pretty much have to use only Apple products for the foreseeable future to get a good experience. You won't have that limitation with Android.

Since you mentioned gaming, I want to add that if you want to do any kind of emulation, you'll probably have an easier time with Android than iOS, but you can do emulation on both.

Edit: One final note is that it's a lot more common to have to purchase apps and subscriptions for certain things, where they may be free on Android. An example of this is moving photos around that you take. You only get a small amount of storage through iCloud for free and its the only real easy way to move files on and off of your phone. Its really common to have to buy a subscription to be able to manage photos easily, where you don't have to do so on Android. You have free access to the files on your device and you don't need to go through a cloud service to easily move things around.

Edit 2: I'm realizing this has become very pro-android where I originally intended it to be unbiased lol. Just want to reiterate that both are great. You won't be unhappy with either.";0

For phones, it is mostly personal preference. The S23 is a very solid device and it isn't heavy, plus comfortable to use. I have the S22+, which is similar in size, and I like the design.

6149;14m18l3;inventord;1688087046.0;"I think I was in a pretty similar situation to you a couple years ago. I went with an S21 Ultra back then, and I still use it today along with my M1 iPad Pro.

Battery life on my phone is pretty decent, and I've heard it's outstanding on the new S23 lineup (especially the plus) with the plus having basically the best battery life on a phone. That said, iPhone also has generally good battery life, even if it's not quite to the same level.

As for performance, it's interesting. Both iPhone 14 Pro and S23+ are extremely fast, and you will have no issues with either. It's generally accepted these days that the Snapdragon 8 gen 2 has a better GPU than the iPhone, while the iPhone 14 Pro has a better CPU. Both will do fine at everything you throw at them.

The cameras on both devices are generally excellent. In normal conditions, both will take excellent photos and videos. The iPhone has traditionally has better video, but I'm happy to say it seems really good this year on the S23 series, basically on par with the iPhone (and it can shoot 8K, if anyone ever actually used it). iPhone tends to produce more true-to-life colors as well with Samsung having more instantly shareable photos (higher saturation generally). Which you prefer is your call. In my experience though, Samsung still gets a win in a few areas: zoom, portrait mode edge detection, night mode, and HDR performance (I notice iPhone still likes to overexpose the sky in many cases which Samsung seems to have solved with some software magic). Samsung also gives you a much more customizable shooting experience, allowing you to shoot in high resolution or even open a full-on pro mode with focus peaking, ISO and shutter speed settings, etc. Many people do prefer the ProRAW captured by iPhone though.

Both devices are pretty similar in terms of durability as far as I'm aware. Both are water and dust resistant, and both use some sort of ""scratch resistant"" display. Apple touts its ceramic shield but it doesn't seem to do much in terms of real world protection compared to the competition.

Biometrics are also pretty similar. Both have face recognition, but Apple's is more secure since Samsung just uses the front camera without special sensors. Apple's method also works in the dark. Samsung has the benefit of a fingerprint scanner, which also works in the dark and with wet/dirty fingers.

Now for the biggest difference: the OS. Android is more customizable, manages notifications better, has more features, and generally gives you more freedom. You can multitask (which I actually use more than I would've thought I would to look at things side-by-side), install apps like YouTube Revanced (basically YouTube premium but with even more features), newpipe, etc. iOS also has its benefits though, with the main one being higher camera quality in social media apps and the integration with other apple products. (To be clear, Samsung's performance in social media apps is still pretty good thanks to Samsung working with the companies, but it's not *quite* as good as iPhone). Many people also prefer the animations on iOS, although animations on Android have gotten really good. Personally, I like the Pixel animations the best, but Samsung animations are really smooth these days. If you want a comparison of them, I'm happy to do one. App quality is also better on iPhone, but it's typically not easy to notice, and I'll gladly make the tradeoff for a universal back gesture that *always* works


I will point out one big gripe I have with iphone though: the keyboard on many android devices (Gboard) is seemingly miles ahead of the one on iOS. It has better autocorrect, a dedicated number row if you want it, themes, etc. Google assistant is also still wayy better than Siri, and I don't see thar changing any time soon. In general, android is just smarter IMO.

Finally, you have the ecosystem. At this point, apple's is just better. If you don't have a Mac though, you might not ever notice it, as my Watch, phone, and PC all work really well these days. I swear Samsung and Google are really catching up, because I can easily ""airdrop"" files to my PC, text, activate my hotspot, etc. Apple gives you things like iMessage and FaceTime as well, which you don't get on Android. There are ways to get them though (I use an app called BlueBubbles, and there are some cool looking apps coming out, one called sunbird, that don't require any kind of Mac at all).

6 months ago I decided to try the apple ecosystem. I sold my OnePlus and went all in with an iphone 14 pm and an apple watch.

Now, if you are a basic user, the iphone will do u wonders. If you however like to customize, use 3rd party apps or expect any manual controls in some apps. iOS will disappoint u heavily as it did me. Hell, u don't even even have the option to add a number row on ur keyboard. You use the device the way apples deems fit and that drove me crazy.

I just sold my iphone and watch and got an s23 ultra and my god I can breath again. Mind u I'm still a heavy ipad user and honestly the ipados is great. iOS on the other hand, is a mess to me personally.

I take notes for classes in goodnotes and write my theses in Microsoft Word, also because I prefer Word to Pages. I don't use my phone to take notes for class or to write theses.

Before I bought the S23+, I also considered the iPhone 14 Pro. I choose the S23+ because ... 

... some Apps I like using for learning (e.g. ankidroid) are much cheaper on the Google Playstore than on the Apple Appstore. 

... when i bought it, there was the preorder free storage upgrade plus I got a few percent off the price through unidays. Unidays currently offers 10% off of Apple products and 15% off of Samsung products if you're ordering them from the Apple/Samsung website. If you're in university and unidays is available in your country, you're eligible for their discounts.

... at most tech shops where I live, you can ""test"" the phones as in there's a model in the store and customers can see how apps like camera, notes, etc. work. This way I found out that I prefer Android over iOS. 

Arguments for the iPhone 14 pro would be that the A16 chip is slightly better than the Sanpdragon 8 Gen2. Apple's camera is also said to be slightly better. I don't have issues with the chip, and I say this as a heavy user and the difference is only small afaik. The camera on the S23+ is fine. The pictures are sharp, even when I zoom in, and most of the time, the colouring is fine (if you turn off image optimization in the camera settings), but sometimes the sky is a little too blue.";0

> Apple Pay is better than android pay

If you mean Google Wallet, I've never found that to be the case. It always works seamlessly on both my phone and my watch, and I've never really had an issue with it. Plus, typically where one platform is accepted the other is as well.

I suppose that's subjective, but both should work on the same amount of websites. I have an iPad Pro and honestly don't see any difference between it and my android device.

6182;14mgyaj;rougecats;1688074201.0;Typically the message is for if the phone detects water in any way and will prevent or limit charging as to not cause any damage, when one of the sensors in the port go out that are supposed to detect this it will continuously believe the device has water in it and cause charging issues. One good way to see is try a wireless charger and see how it works for you;0

Notice with last update (original in French). Why he would indicate it if we could simply go to the center. After that, I guess there are tools. But it means formatting. And it will cost money. Why should a bug he created cost me money? Then I'll wait. In the meantime I put it in battery saver mode with cpu speed reduction. That seems to solve the problem. It sucks to lose performance.

6236;14m4q7q;Carbon24K;1688048654.0;Thank you for the reply. Having access and getting permission are two very big and different things.  When they install apps on anyone's phone without direct permission, they are using the resources on the phone for their profit.  And that's assuming nothing bad is taking place.  Also opens up the phone to hacking via Samsung.  Getting installed apps that were installed on a new phone, just purchased, is different from installing apps on an existing phone.  Again thx for reading my rant.;0

I came from a s10+ which was already big but slim, I didn't have to use both hands to hold it however, I use both hands to hold the s23U (My right hand hold most of the weight with my index finger on the front edge of my case and pressed along side my palm all the way down to my pinky. My left hand is off my phone but I'm using my middle finger and thumb to hold it.). It's pretty heavy to use with one hand and I feel like I might drop my phone if I use one hand for too long. If I'm on my back laying down. I e learned I can use one hand better if I use my index finger on the edge of my case with middle finger curled on the back bottom edge of the phone and my thumb holding the bottom and my hold is much stronger that way. I use a Spigen case with a kick stand in the back. I trust this brand and I've used it since having my s7. Not once have I broken my phone and I drop all my phones lol 
   As a woman with woman pockets I do hate that my phone can barely fit in my BACK pocket but in some jeans it does fit ok. I don't like bringing purses with me so that's kinda my only option and im really weary that ppl can see my expensive phone on my rear. 

All in all, I do not regret it. I love the phone and I LOVE the battery life. I have it on power saving (charges up to only 85%) all the time unless I need to go on a trip. I use TikTok for about 1 to 3 hours a day and casual browsing. At the end of my day, I watch some episodes until I fall asleep which about 3 hours. When I wake up my phone is around 35 to 10%! Since buying my phone, which has been about 3 months now, I've only needed to charge my phone once a day. It's fantastic.";0

It's a great idea because you can prevent someone from erasing or adding a new esim which pretty much locks it up. I could be mistaken but I don't believe you can add a physical sim with the SIM locked either.

It also prevents someone from stealing your phone and trying to erase your esim and replace it with their own and keep your phone or sell it on the black market.";0

6382;14m0xeo;Captain_Kahn;1688094684.0;"Good evening all this going to be a wall of text and I apologize ahead of time. 

I ordered a Samsung CU8000 TV for ~500USD that was delivered June 13th as a gift to my younger sister. The television was delivered without its power cord and no remote. 

The same day I contacted Samsung support who put me though the ringer as I tried to resolve this issue. It was eventually resolved with them agreeing to send me a new power cord and remote through warranty. The power cable arrived ~7 days later with no TV remote and my ticket was closed. 

I called Samsung support again to figure out why the remote wasn't sent and they claimed there was a processing error in their system and claimed to have rectified it. 

9 days later the remote still hasn't arrived, so I have once again called Samsung support who've advised that another processing error prevented the remote from shipping and that they will send the remote to me free of charge when it was their fault I never received a remote in the first two instances. They also told me it could be another 5 to 14 days for the remote to show up. That would mean I've had a 500USD investment that's been utterly useless for a full month.

Now I'm being put through the ringer again when I'm asking if there's any way they can compensate me for the issues that they've caused, and if they can expedite the shipping of the TV remote. The only consolation I've been given from a supervisor is that they can attempt to expedite the process but even that's not a guarantee.

I've had Samsung products for a long time. Counting off on several dumb tvs, a Galaxy Note 3, S3 Frontier and S8+, a Note 10+ and Galaxy Fit, S20 Ultra and Watch Active2, and S22 Ultra with Watch4. Not including several pairs of Galaxy Buds and a Q6F Special Edition QLED tv. I would say I don't usually get frustrated or push for compensation on simple customer service mistakes but IMHO this isn't a simple mistake anymore and I'm not sure who to reach out to so that this issue can be fully rectified.

For most tasks, there is little difference, the S21 generation is still good enough for today's applications. Applications start a little faster and games are a little smoother with the S23 but you really have to push it harder to have a noticeable difference.

Nowadays, Samsung provides 4 years of OneUI / Android updates so that means that the S21 FE will stay current until 2025. That does not means it will stop to work from one day to the next.

You should not expect a huge gap in performance and shall rather motivate you change with features you don't have or improved battery life on the S23 range. 

Beware that the Fold 4 is not really an upgrade but a sidestep to a different category and you have to be ready for the compromises foldables have to make to provide the big internal foldable screen.

6441;14l8vix;ojasmohan;1687968923.0;I have the watch 4 and honestly it does everything I want it to. Granted I use it mostly for notifications and fitness tracking but still, it's a great watch for both of those things. I will say, the OS is a bit laggy at times but it's not too bad.;0
6442;14l8vix;Maos_KG;1687970817.0;Yeah, I love my watch 4. I previously had the 1st gen and that thing was awesome. I ended up giving it to my dad since I upgraded to the 2. The 2 was super nice as well, but I put it through the ringer that's for sure lol 😂 and it ended up not working or turning on and off on its own, so I eventually upgraded to the 4 and I've been loving it, definitely doesn't get as abused as my 2 did.;0

Secondly, a firmware was pushed to mine at some point and that firmware bricked mine and others. I haven't been able to turn it on without it going through a vicious rebooting loop.

I bought it with the full knowledge that it's at best a 1.5day a full charge watch though, so it's not a big deal to me. Just didn't think just adding another half a day of charge is worth 2x the cost of the watch (Watch 5 40mm costs 2.5x the Watch 4 where I live, and the Watch5 Pro costs 4x).";0

I'm about to upgrade to the 5 Pro as it seems to have 2 days of screen on time battery life or at least a week with the screen off. The Watch 4 is maybe 1 day screen on time (?) and maybe 2.5 days with the screen off. I am honestly not happy with that.";0

Honestly, for the first time in years, I've been considering switching to iPhone. I've had the S3, S6, S7, S8, Note 8, Note 9, Note 20U, Fold 3, Fold 4, and now currently the S23U.

Early on each upgrade felt pretty significant and was extremely exciting, and with each software update came big changes and features.

Ever since the Note 9/S20U, every phone has felt identical and less and less exciting. I dream and hope for a majore OS release to make me excited about the phone again bit each time I'm left disappointed.  I thought folding phones would bring the excitement back, and they did for a time, but the cons outweighed the pros.

That all being said, I know Iphones aren't better, they lack features and have subjectively worse specs. However,  the OS experience would be a dramatic change and they have a ton of charm in ther animations/UI/graphics etc. Eveyr feature feels planned and matured.

I just want my phones to be exciting again. Idk if they would come from making the jump to iPhone or not, but I'm considering giving it a test drive.

Amazon offers a 90 day return window on used devices. Tempted to buy a renewed iPhone and take it for a spin for a month and see how it compares.

6560;14kvrsw;Hextato;1688008300.0;"1. **Consistent Material You.**  I find it embarrassing how Samsung managed to make their apps so inconsistent with the theming. 1st party apps should be themed accordingly. It's the bare minimum. Also some apps don't even completely follow One UI theme rules like one hand reachability of some apps like Samsung Music.

2. **Animation revamp.** Honestly, the main thing One UI lacks behind is animations, especially when it comes to fluidity like the stock Android.

3. **120hz screen recorder.** It's currently locked to 60fps, which is fine, but could be way better.

4. **Declutter and combine apps**. Samsung's additional apps are way too much and needs to be incorporated within other built in apps like camera assistant and expert raw should be into the main camera app, enhance-x should be a part of the gallery, Samsung Health and Health Monitor should be combined, and so much more especially with Good lock that should be incorporated into the system. It's a way to declutter and simplify so much things.

5. **Optimize One UI.** One UI is a heavy skin. On flagships, it runs great even after years, but on midrange and entry level phones, the experience just sucks. This could also help improve battery life as the drain is bad for a lot of people.

6. **Lock screen widgets.** Underrated and underrused feature hidden behind tapping the clock. They should bring this out to be more accessible and useful.

6660;14kvrsw;stelgado;1687970261.0;I don’t understand your point. Optimisation is all in all a good thing for any phone. And no one does it better than Apple, because of obvious reasons. That’s why they can afford to sell under spec’d phones and they still run smoothly.;0
6661;14kvrsw;dbneo;1689073061.0;OneUI has pretty aggressive background app management. Even placed the worst. Check dontkillmyapp.com;0
6662;14kvrsw;general_clausewitz;1687981900.0;"Under specd?

Apple Silicon SoCs are flagship grade. They beat android SoCs pretty easily while drawing less power. Hence better battery life.

The only significant area iPhones are under specd is their RAM. That's fixed by aggressive ram management at the cost of User Engagement and experience. 

There's a difference between aggressive optimization and optimization. At least that's how I see it. Apple's optimization is king. The ecosystem also allows for third-party optimizations to be very easy. Android has a million different devices so you definitely miss out on the specific third-party optimizations. That's not to discount the fact that apple does it better and Android has reasons for it's optimization problems.

OEMs like Google, Samsung started optimizing really well. At least their flagships. The real under specd affordable smooth king is Pixel. 

Android feels comfortable when you multitask. In pursuit of matching with apple, I just don't want to lose android what it's good for. Aggressive optimization is not good in every case. 

Eg:
- Battery optimization - how are you doing it? By killing apps aggressively in the background? I don't want it.

- Ram management - same as above

Apple strength is Apple itself.

Android weakness at least on the ease to optimize is android itself.";0
6663;14kvrsw;general_clausewitz;1689075230.0;"I'm using OneUI and if I'm using reddit and leave the app on a post, then I get back after 2 days. It's still on that page. That's pretty good. Leaving downloads with screen off, I downloaded a 67 GB video and it went on for a couple of hours and Android didn't kill it. Things like these are so much better on Android. All my apps have default battery settings. 

If it's the notifications you are talking about, the most used ones which I have notifications turned on work well. In some cases are delayed by 3-4 minutes. Of course these are managed by Google Play Services so can't really blame samsung. I'm happy with background app management. Sometimes I'm so annoyed when I open some of the apps and they still stay on the same page but I was expecting to start anew so that I don't have to press back multiple times to get there and refresh the app for new content.

Edit: Of course If you want always running apps like vpns and others, that's where OneUI might be rated the worse. You can remedy that by changing the app battery settings and you are good to go. It's also needed only once.";0

6754;14kramg;Armandeluz;1688582818.0;I don't think you understand his question fully. Apple and Samsung intentionally make it difficult to switch to other companies. It heavily relies on you syncing your contact to Gmail and after moving vendors those synching back. This works seamlessly using a Gmail account to anything. If you save everything on your Samsung account, you do not always have everything transferred over unless you are using their new Onedrive Microsoft option. Calendar doesn't sync at all leaving Samsung. This is also true for Apple. They do not have the ecosystem setup for you to leave them only importing in certain situations. Only flawless to upgrade with their respective platforms. Always use google for everything regardless of the vendor. If you're on apple, keep google contact sync on for that reason. You can always download your files and pics from Google drive. Apple photos doesn't work like that.;0

Had S10 since release until a month ago, changed it because the charging port stopped working reliably, battery was less effective but still good, it had a cracked screen, but still worked fine. Only reason I changed is the charging port.

I like the S22, but miss the headphone jack on S10, I have good wired earphones and when bluetooth dies on my bluetooth headphones the direct port is useful.

No regrets, but would recommend S23 over S22 for better battery life if the cost is comparable. S22 has better battery life than my old S10, but not as much of an upgrade as S23.

If I could have gotten another new (not refurbed) S10 for a reasonable price would have stuck with S10.

SO:

\- LOS 18 by enesuzun2002: smooth performance (this does not apply for all scenario). Pretty pleasant. LOS have a BAD camera app, no hdr, bad focus. OK battery life (no game).

\- LOS 19/20 by fakemanoan: if you love Material You. Ram usage is high. Most of the time app will reload instantly when you exited it. Not so ok battery life. The dev is still actively working on it so just wait.

\- FloydROM/OneUI1: most customizable. It's OneUI. Good battery life (I don't play game on it). Decent camera app, with HDR, good autofocus. Good AOD (it's working pretty well on S6 with little draining even though it's not supported). Might lag sometimes, you will want to tweak some settings in hktweaks (app preinstalled).

I am not sure if this is the bootloop as I couldn't find much information with this exact scenario

A relative of mine has an old J5 that's we change the battery for a new one because it wouldn't turn on, now when it turns on it sits at the Samsung logo that keeps lighting up and dimming without stop

I tried a few methods to turn on the phone including: - power button + volume up - power button + volume down - power button + volume down and up - power button + home button + volume buttons

None of which work When the phone is plugged to charger the animation for charging appears as normal

Can I still save the phone? (For photos and other info stores on it)";0

6852;14l5bn7;chopkinsbass;1687974536.0;"I know people have reported ""banana"" images with the S23's camera but is anybody else experiencing warping with the video camera modes?

For the last few weeks, whenever I do videos of myself playing the bass for my YouTube channel, there's a lot of warping at the edges of the videos.  I thought it was a focusing or stabilization issue but it's happening with manual focus, auto focus as well as image stabalization on or off.  It's also happening in 3rd party apps such as Filmic Pro and Open Camera.

Ironically it's not happening when I use my A52 and A41s.

I've reset the phone, cleared settings and updated to latest version available (mine is running Android 13 and One UI 5.1).  

As an example - this is a video I filmed when I got the S23 and there isn't any noticeable warping or distortion:  [(1) EP 129 ZZ Top - Legs - Bass Cover (includes onscreen tab and downloadable tab) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9whjoyU0XP0) 

This is one I did recently and you can see it is really pronounced, especially on the right hand side of the video.  Also - the neck looks like it's exhibiting ""banana"" characteristics as per the issue with images  [(1) faith synched trimmed - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oswWIpCNR7M) 

Any advice?  I originally thought it was some sort of vibration issue but I filmed a silent video where I did the same thing.";0
6853;14l5bn7;ManItsLonely;1687974685.0;"I have had Samsung QE55Q60T for a couple of years now. I’m not sure if the bar’s name is On Screen Display or Playback Control Bar or what, but it’s that bar at the bottom that appears when you’re watching something (specifically an external device) and you use your controller arrows, it pops up from below and gives you options to scroll forward/backwards, fast forward/backwards, changing subtitles/audio, about, etc..

The problem: when I use the controller it pops up, after I’m done using it and resuming the movie, it remains on screen for 15 seconds which is a LONG time to have something unwanted taking up 1/3 of your screen after you’re done with it. 

It used to be that it lasted less than 10 seconds but I’m not sure if I did something with the settings or if some update had changed the way it behaves but I really want to change the time it remains on my screen after not using any button. Anyone has any ideas?";0

6859;14l5bn7;Inevitable-Bath9142;1688027115.0;"OPINION: Relegating tech support to a temporary thread is a really bad idea because discussions on issues (that are widely crowd-sourced in the way only Reddit can provide) can help people facing the same issue, and be found through a search on Google or Reddit. Furthermore keeping them open increases the chance that someone who reads the thread and later finds info or a fix will add it.

Not allowing ""What should I buy threads"" is ridiculously restrictive as evidenced by the fact that the majority of posts are currently directly or indirectly related to choosing what to buy. Not allowing the above categories means that the only news allowed is about new products and company affairs which is something only someone interested in tracking Silicon Valley or whatnot would be interested in and very niche.";0

You have to be kidding me??

Don't you realize that most questions are solved ""over time""? If you can't find them independently in their own thread they can't become discussions in their own right that help future users who find them on Google or Reddit.

People who post questions aren't expecting that someone who has the laydown on products will be able to see them and answer them which is what you seem to think of this as. They're expecting crowd-sourced responses from people who've had the same issue.
